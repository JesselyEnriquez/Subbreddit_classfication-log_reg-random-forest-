It's in regard to American oil reserves and independence) 

So I had a friend state that since Biden was in office, we've lost oil independence. I'll admit that I don't have any idea where we are in that regard, but I wanted to know more so I did as best as I can to look it up. I found [this website](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&amp;s=mttntus2&amp;f=m) which shows our net imports of oil, and it seems to me that we're still oil independent. I understand that we're not producing 100% of our own oil, but that the term ""Oil Independence"" is generally accepted to be just a net exporter of oil which makes sense to me. 

This got me thinking, how much oil do we have in the ground? Like if we keep pumping oil out of the ground at the same rate as we are today, when is oil going to run out? In [this site](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=33&amp;t=6) I see that  our consumption is about 7 billion barrels a year, and [this article](https://money.cnn.com/2016/07/05/investing/us-untapped-oil/index.html#:~:text=That's%20according%20to%20a%20new,billion%20barrels%20of%20oil%20reserves.) claims we have about 260 billion barrels underground in the USA still. That leads to about 37 years of oil left at the given rate (barring technology advances that make more oil recoverable, which I know is inevitable). This number seems roughly in line with other articles I found stating around 40 years of oil supply left give or take.

Anyways, assuming I'm reasonably understanding the previous statements, I'm wondering why energy independence is such a big goal for the United States? I understand wanting the *ability* to be entirely independent, but why would we use American oil when we could be using oil from other countries that are more than happy to sell it to us? Certainly not importing 100% of our oil, but if we could import enough to stretch our 30 year supply our to 60 or 100. Then 30 and 40 years down the road when the supply starts to dry up abroad, the USA still has plenty of oil underground and is in a much better situation then. In the meanwhile, work on green/renewable energy sources in the hopes that 40 years from now all that underground oil will end up lasting longer and longer as time goes on.

Anyways, sorry for the naivety of my post, but I don't particularly follow this aspect of politics and I haven't seen anyone bring up the talking point of where our country will be a half century down the line in regards to oil.

Foucault, for better or for worse, made a strong case that knowledge and power are inextricably linked. The right dissemination of information can either maintain power or destroy it. This is just patently true. And while information and media CAN hold truth to power and expose horrible atrocities, it can also do the exact opposite. The media is often used to downplay unfortunate truths about the state, a politician, or a historical event. This in turn affects voting habits. So in a way, the electoral consent of the people is manufactured by the media in which they gravitate towards.
 
Even the democratic party practically admitted that this is the case whenever they accused Russia of interfering in American politics through bots on Facebook and other social media. If democracy is so fragile that random accounts spewing misinformation can greatly shift the results of an election, then how much more power do big media conglomerates have when it comes to selecting candidates and promoting politcal ideologies?

I understand that multiple parties are constantly attempting to influence public opinion and democracy, so it isn't as simple as saying that it's flat out ""rigged"" (like an illuminati-esque conspiracy theory would suggest).

Not allowing any more former Soviet republics to join NATO may be a reasonable accommodation to give to Russia.

It's understandable that seeing that spreading so close to their borders can be seen as threatening.

The longer version of the question and the backstory as is follows:

1. Some cities in the US have considered tracking foreign ownership of residential real estate in part to get a better idea of its impact on real estate prices. At least one member of the Seattle City Council asked the King County Assessor for hard data on this topic but the KC Assessor said that wasn't his offices job and they didn't have the data or the resources to get that data. Since Seattle is fairly close to Vancouver BC, and Vancouver BC taxes foreign ownership at a different rate than domestic ownership, some in Seattle had wondered if they could do something similar.

2. This idea was eventually squelched by the Seattle City Attorney that said US Treaty laws forbid states or cities from having special taxes on foreign owned property (they must be taxed at the same rates as domestic property by states &amp; counties... any special taxes can only be implemented at the federal level) -- I might be paraphrasing a bit but that was the gist as I recall.

I'm sure one of the reasons we allow foreign ownership of US real estate is because we want other nations to allow ownership of their real estate by US entities -- and so reciprocity would suggest if we want the right to own property in places like Mexico or Canada or Spain... etc... then we must also allow entities from those nations to own property in the US. Beyond this, what are the other reasons that we allow foreign ownership of US real estate and property?

I am aware that both Canada and Mexico place some restrictions on what they allow. Canada taxes foreign ownership at a higher rate (Vancouver does anyway) and Mexico allows foreign ownership of land only in certain areas and makes other areas off limits to foreign ownership. Could the US do any of what Canada or Mexico are doing without violating our Treaty agreements? In short... if they can do it why can't we?

What I realised is that if I wanted to start reading politics I would first have to start reading philosophy on which I can ground my political worldview and this is where the question comes in. At first I figured I should just go through the most influential books in philosophy after getting some sort of introduction, so I first read a basically philosophy textbook and I've already ordered Russel's history of western philosophy after which I had a list that looks something like: Republic, Metaphyiscs, Hume, Descartes, Mill, Rawls, Kant, Rousseau, etc.. A problem I have with this approach though, is that although I enjoy philosophy as something akin to a hobby, ultimately I am looking to just get to the politics part and don't care too much about epistemology and the such, so I thought what if I just read a lot of ethics, like Justice (Sandel), Mill and Rawls, then some more focused works, and I can save a lot of time that way without losing much.

We have been reading about the importance of ""Pivoting to Asia"" for some years now, and Asia rising economies is often the cited reason. IMF or World Bank 2030-2050 estimations have high projections for Asian countries , e.g. Indonesia, and some mention that Asian economies would account for 50% of world GDP (e.g., vs 10% EU). But If we look at GDP per capita projections, Asian economies are not the majority of the top countries.

So sure Asian countries would have strong activity within their economies but for an Asian person, it is probably better to move to a country with a good GDP per capita projections, e.g. Norway, for personal wealth.

However, Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe has previously [argued that the VP cannot do this](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/09/23/opinion/no-hiding-behind-pences-skirt-supreme-court-nomination/) when it come to the Senate acting in its capacity to 'advise and consent' (bold added):

&gt;While the vice president has the power to cast a tiebreaking vote to pass a bill, **the Constitution does not give him the power to break ties when it comes to the Senate’s “Advice and Consent” role in approving presidential appointments to the Supreme Court**.  
&gt;  
&gt;You don’t have to take my word for it. Alexander Hamilton said the same thing way back in 1788, in Federalist No. 69: “**In the national government, if the Senate should be divided, no appointment could be made.**” Hamilton contrasted that rule with how appointments worked back then in his home state of New York, where the governor actually did have the power to break ties to confirm nominations to New York state offices.  
&gt;  
&gt;Consistent with Hamilton’s understanding, as two thoughtful recent scholarly analyses have pointed out, **no vice president in our history has ever cast a tiebreaking vote to confirm an appointment to the Supreme Court**. 

There's more [at the link](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/09/23/opinion/no-hiding-behind-pences-skirt-supreme-court-nomination/) going into the specifics of the argument and why allowing the VP to break a SCOTUS nomination tie would be unconstitutional.

Food for thought / rambling: As an independent voter in the US, my party association at any given time could in theory be determined by assigning weights to each unique issue and then comparing my weights to the estimated weights of each party and selecting based on a summation fit. If someone primary belief system is Methodist Christian faith, there is likely a large weight associated with pro-life, and traditional marriage issues. Do these people generally care less about the environment? Statistically, probably yes. But is that determined directly by their belief system, or by their association with a party that places a lower emphasis on their environment, which they associate with because of their huge weights in the 2 previously mentioned issues? What about capitalism as a belief system. The bible says you can not serve both God and money, yet conservatives tend to be both more religious and in support of free market enterprise.

If these children were to be legally assigned to the father, the women could yet re-marry and conceive more children, while the fathers raise the original children, while allowing mothers to be part of their lives.

This explanation seems entirely reasonable to me, so I've always been very skeptical of the claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election that many Trump fans make. And of course, there's also the fact that the trump team's efforts in court were completely unsuccessful, the audits, the inconsistent claims from Trump officials in and outside of court, and so on.

However, for the first time I've encountered a voter fraud claim which actually seems semi-though out. I'm still very skeptical of it of course because of the aforementioned reasons, but I didn't just want to dismiss it without understanding if the claim is true. The claim was basically that only those crucial states (Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Georgia) saw those sudden spikes, whereas other states (the specific examples were Nevada, California, Illinois, Maryland, Arizona, Indiana, and Maine) did not. It's argued that that something uniquely fishy is therefore going on in those four states, rather than a delay in counting mail-in or urban-area votes which one would expect to see consistently throughout the whole country.

Or at least, that's the argument. It's detailed in a public google doc here (the doc isn't mine):  https://docs.google.com/document/d/10j1IeSneQyD9TgHqXrXb9l-ACrOlSVG2J9ybjCz2E4s/ 

So back to my title question, did any states aside from Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Georgia (and also Nevada, California, Illinois, Maryland, Arizona, Indiana, and Maine if he's telling the truth about those states) have similar pro-Biden vote spikes, presumably because of similar vote-counting protocol? Or is the protocol unique only to those crucial swing states purely out of coincidence? Or is that doc wrong for some other reason?

The Greeks had revolted and were threatening to abandon the European Union and perhaps this distracted Berlin and Paris together with ensuring the other mediterranean countries had stability. 

Its very odd how the Euros and Anglos put little effort into that Ukrainian election. Did they see Medvedev as cute and harmless? Or did they perhaps feel interfering in Ukraine and supporting Timoshenko would perhaps backfire on them? Where they just too busy?

&gt; Moreover, liberal practices on the ground have
institutional consequences, and those consequences are woven into a grand—and sometimes self-congratulatory—historical tapestry. Many of thosepractices are contained in the phrase ‘liberal democracy’. As a principle ofgood government, liberal democracy has firm roots in numerous countriesand is an aspirational goal in others. It has a clear message: democracy, ifby that we mean the rule of the people, is all well and good, but winningelections and popular government on their own are merely a minimum kit.
That kit is necessary but insufficient for a political system to be called‘liberal’. Liberals maintain that democracy must display additionalcharacteristics for it to be considered a worthy system of government.Democracy needs to be fair, tolerant, inclusive, restrained, and self-critical,not simply the pursuit of majority rule. Liberal democracy involves not just
elections, but free elections. It involves not just representative government,but accountable and constrained government. It involves not just the right tovote, but the equal and unsupervised right to vote. And it involves attentionto the well-being of all the members of a society, a principle that requiressome governmental activity but may be open to different interpretations.The qualities liberals demand are extensive and varied: it is a lot easier topreach liberalism than to realize it.

&gt; Liberal practices affect constitutions, the degree of openness permitted inpolitical debate, and the basket of rights that societies are willing todistribute among their members. Often, too, they involve ambitiousschemes of redistributing wealth to increase the life chances of all, althoughsome commentators, usually from a conservative or libertarian perspective,might deplore that as a form of socialism. And, as usually is the case with any ideology, a gap may open up between declared principles and effective
practice. Liberal principles may be breached even by those subscribing tothem, and some societies reject them out of hand. In that case, we may haveto decide whether liberal principles or liberal practices bring us closer toidentifying what is typical of liberalism. Assessing liberalism is not an
armchair intellectual activity—though there is nothing wrong with that. Itrelates rather to what kind of politics a society engages in at the coalface.

I understand some parts of it—that there is a divergence between liberal practice and liberal principles, that liberals value liberal democracys, etc.—but not others, the other bits being what I think he's getting at.

Do you notice how there was lots of ramble and complaints against China at the time in 1950, yet today, as of 2021, 70 years later, nobody cares about Tibet anymore; there are no imposed sanctions on China because of Tibet occupation. 

However, the territory remains. It's not like anyone will take Tibet away from China, and it's not like Tibet has nuclear arms and the capacity to declare independence.

Ukraine seems similar, lacking nuclear arms and strong allies (not part of NATO).

Even if Russia's already awful economy suffers more for a few decades, the long-term gain will be EV positive as Russia will benefit from the expanded territory.

So while they will suffer a few decades of awful economy, it's not like anyone will take Ukraine back from them because of the nuclear deterrent.

Taking this into account, it almost seems that it makes sense to occupy territories and expand as much as possible even if the economy suffers from it for nuclear nations. People will forget and forgive over time, but the territory will remain.

\--------POST---------

Countries   are different, I get that. So I'm not passing judgment on stuff like  single party rule, or the Chinese way of doing things. One thing I can't get over though, is the censorship. Why does the Chinese government   have to have a separate Internet, and stop free speech? So many of my   possible misconceptions in China will vanish if the Chinese government   doesn't censor.

**Example 1:**   The recent outrage of the disappearance of the Chinese tennis player   Peng Shuai. If there was complete freedom of speech without censorship,   this whole thing could have been cleared up in hours. Any journalist   could have simply walked up to her house and interviewed her, then   posted the interview on Twitter or Reddit. Problem solved! Instead of   that, we had to rely on formally released letters approved by the   government. That's not a good look. And even now after videos showing   her moving around, there's always a doubt because a journalist can't   just interview her and tell China and the whole world that she's ok.

**Example 2:**   The whole Uighur situation. With complete free speech, anyone could   just walk up to a so-called camp, video tape everything, then post it on   Youtube. If there's nothing going on, it would be super easy to find   out the truth. Can that happen right now?

This is my biggest problem with the Chinese government. Free speech and no censorship in the long-run fosters trust.

**To Clarify:** To clarify, I'm talking about *government*   censorship. I see many people here saying that the US also censors   stuff, when what they mean is that the US media doesn't cover   everything, or is biased. That is not censorship. Censorship is when the   government forcibly removes or bans content. In the US, the government   doesn't own any media, so censorship is not possible.",True,False,False,Askpolitics,t5_2s5s2,2503,public,top,self,"Banned from 3 China Subreddits, Where to Ask Chinese People Respectful Questions?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Askpolitics/comments/qznx4n/banned_from_3_china_subreddits_where_to_ask/,some_ads,7,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'Cb0EFTRx7ToBovcT8coUZdPYqNqEPmRoXeJExqffAZg', 'resolutions': [{'height': 47, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/TUyUOY7JQhk5rIzPWavLaEQKY73qxNVev8Jj0HSoJuA.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1dcd0dda2baeed20a584af40dbe334f4e10682f', 'width': 108}, {'height': 94, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/TUyUOY7JQhk5rIzPWavLaEQKY73qxNVev8Jj0HSoJuA.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=854eda148a27ebb6ea2a4909d7faf402b0b81fb0', 'width': 216}, {'height': 139, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/TUyUOY7JQhk5rIzPWavLaEQKY73qxNVev8Jj0HSoJuA.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c416985cb1324ef296a6458760ef83c7399a6dda', 'width': 320}, {'height': 279, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/TUyUOY7JQhk5rIzPWavLaEQKY73qxNVev8Jj0HSoJuA.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a84cb438f326b192df20bca80299ef66b2514e7d', 'width': 640}, {'height': 419, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/TUyUOY7JQhk5rIzPWavLaEQKY73qxNVev8Jj0HSoJuA.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32b18ffc41c26b67f4125227051de8a3f0e4740d', 'width': 960}, {'height': 472, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/TUyUOY7JQhk5rIzPWavLaEQKY73qxNVev8Jj0HSoJuA.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87cde975798736035d8074b3c65a60be7c266dbc', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 486, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/TUyUOY7JQhk5rIzPWavLaEQKY73qxNVev8Jj0HSoJuA.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=5a6214055a4f59cd3224aaa7abaab69a852e8f06', 'width': 1112}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

What do you think of their 25-point platform?



1. The United States of America will be declared an outpost of Western civilization and a state dedicated to its European-heritage population and their posterity. It will be the policy of the state to set immigration and natal policy that will ensure a permanent European majority. The rights of historic minority populations will be respected.

2. We demand the extension of the 1964 Civil Rights act to provide equal protections and privileges to the White majority, or the act must be repealed.

3. We support the nationalization and strategic break ups of banks, mass media, and monopolistic corporations in order to create public accountability and guarantee that they serve the nation first.

4. We support a two percent ceiling on Jewish employment in vital institutions so that they better represent the ethnic and regional population balance of the country.

5. We support the sacred rights of free speech, freedom of religion and freedom of association. Political views will not be censored by the state or any large private concerns. It will be illegal for any employer to retaliate against workers for political activism and expression outside the workplace.

6. We support private property rights, including a program to make home ownership more accessible to stably employed family men. Small businesses and communities will be granted the right to refuse service or home ownership to anyone for any reason they see fit.

7. We stand firm in defense of the right of law abiding citizens to own firearms.

8. We demand the FBI, which acts as nothing more than a political secret police force for elite interests, be abolished and replaced with a legitimate federal law enforcement agency.

9. We demand an end to political contributions and corporate lobbying. Elections must be publicly financed.

10. The corrupt two party system must be abolished and replaced by a system that offers real representation to racial groups and economic classes.

11. We oppose America’s ongoing military entanglements and demand the return of all troops to the homeland. We will engage in diplomacy under the doctrine of ”America First” and cease the internationalist project of exporting liberalism.

12. We will nationalize the defense industry and make war profiteering a criminal act. All able bodied men will be conscripted into national service.

13. Lobbying on behalf of foreign nations will be banned and classified as espionage. Foreign negotiations will be conducted through official diplomatic channels.

14. We will declare Israel a rogue state and exporter of terrorism. The national rights of the Palestinian people must be respected.

15. We will establish a new economic policy that stresses the family wage, full and stable employment, and a strong middle class. We will abolish the income tax on productive work and put this burden on capital and speculative income.

16. We call for correcting the power imbalance between labor and management through a national labor organization that guarantees employee rights.

17. We support an industrial plan that brings home capital and manufacturing and invests in our depressed and de-industrialized heartland. We will implement massive public works projects to modernize our crumbling infrastructure.

18. Usurious and predatory lending practices will be outlawed. All credit will be issued by the state with no middle-man profiteers.

19. Health care is a right. Health care must be removed from the control of for-profit hospitals and insurance companies and made a public service for all people. Preventative care will be emphasized and physical fitness will be promoted.

20. We will restore reason, logic and tradition to the education system by implementing a comprehensive classical curriculum. Homosexual, neoliberal, and transgender propaganda will be explicitly banned from being taught to children.

21. We will establish a Department of Culture that will oversee the creation of art and architecture to enlighten the public through beauty and transcendence. Suburbs and small towns will be revitalized with beautification projects to make them walkable and attractive and to encourage social life.

22. The state must act as the steward of the environment. Industrial and economic needs will be balanced with quality of life and the preservation of natural beauty. Wildlife will be protected, and we will expand national parks and wilderness areas. Religious slaughter and other inhumane treatment of animals will be banned.

23. We support strong families. Married women will be paid by the state to care for their children. No fault divorce will be repealed, and homosexual marriage will be banned.

24. The benefits of automation will be shared among all citizens. Technological advancement will be used to reduce work hours, raise wages, lower the retirement age and increase pensions.

25. In order to put an end to racial conflict and hate, all people will be entitled to be policed, educated, and judged by individuals of their own race. No longer will any race be exploited for the benefit of another in America.

I’m not anti-vax, clearly. As it is, Covid is a virus that is only half as mutagenic as the Flu, but 10x more deadly. This is the facts. Since it’s a virus, we can expect that Covid will continue to exist as a threat of some level, probably higher than the Flu. And like the Flu, we will probably be urged to take a yearly vaccine during the season that Covid is the most powerful, just like with the Flu. 

In an ideal world, everyone would have gotten a vaccine that seemed the safest (seems to be pfizer) after waiting a bit to temper doubts of side effects. Then the Covid vaccine would have gotten yearly funding like the Flu vaccine does. 

But if this is not the case, why would you go about fixing this with a lockdown? Primarily, we have evidence that people who are vaccinated spread the virus just as unvaccinated people do. They just don’t die or arrive at the hospital MUCH less. Thus, lockdowning the unvaccinated will do nothing to stop the spread. It’s hard to enforce, and will require constant authoritarianism to enforce. Meanwhile, if such authoritarianism is on the table, a vaccine mandate is a one-time infringement on rights that would greatly boost the safety of the country so that most people who do get it don’t die, reducing the danger down to a normal Flu. Should that not be the goal? Is the Austrian government actually that incompetent, or is it legitimately the result of a government trying to take greater control?

If you care to know I consider myself socially liberal &amp; fiscally conservative. I come here because I hope to get some different perspectives on the topic.

First off I don't intend to have the subject come off as a loaded question, but I really can't think of any other way to write it. From what I've seen it looks like many Charter Schools are quite successful as an alternative to public schools. And [Democratic voters are for Charter Schools.](https://www.usnews.com/news/elections/articles/2019-10-07/poll-democratic-primary-voters-support-charter-schools) It's quite common to see Republican candidates champion Charter Schooling and without saying also are highly for School Vouchers.

But then you look at the Democratic Leaders, there's no other way to put it they're largely indifferent if not hostile to Charter Schooling. [This 2020 article from Ballotpedia shows it.](https://ballotpedia.org/2020_presidential_candidates_on_charter_schools_and_voucher_programs) President Joe Biden said he's against Charter Schools and talked that he'd ban federal funding of them saying ""it siphons off money from Public Schools."" Bernie Sanders declared that he would ban Charter Schools because they're run by for-profit companies. From my count only 4 of the 2020 Democratic Candidates showed support for Charter Schools; Cory Booker, Bill Weld, Mark Sanford, and Andrew Yang. And only Booker is currently in elected office. The rest didn't mention it (or Ballotpedia failed to find their stance) or they downright opposed it.

I already have the conservative knee-jerk answer, ""Democrats receive strong support from Teachers Unions so it's in their best interests to make said unions happy."" But Democratic leaders have shown the ability to not be controlled by unions, I mean they chose Green Energy over the Coal Miners union.

So I'm seeing a lot of blame being thrown on Joe Biden for making fuel prices high across the US, and the entire world for rush matter. The main cause being he reportedly shut down local production of oil. Now, I've been doing a fair bit of searching for any information on this, and I have come up with absolutely nothing. The only things I can see are:


Biden tried to halt new leases, but it was blocked by a [federal judge](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/amp/politics/federal-judge-blocks-bidens-pause-on-new-oil-and-gas-leases)

And the [oil production numbers](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/amp/politics/federal-judge-blocks-bidens-pause-on-new-oil-and-gas-leases) haven't dropped ""by half"" as I've seen claimed. A small dip, but fairly consistent.

So my question is this, how exactly has he shut down local production and made gas prices so high? I'm seeing a lot of people parroting it, but nobody seems to be able to provide a source.

Again, I'm not American, I really don't care for Joe Biden, I'm just trying to sate my curiosity, because so far I haven't been able to do it myself.

In international relations, it is all too often repeated that countries don't do things out of pure kindness of their hearts and that countries don't have permanent friends only permanent interests. The left demand to cut off relations or punish authoritarian regimes that the West are allied with or regimes that violate human rights, and rightfully so. However, the left don't seem to realise that some of these regimes happen to have vital strategic resources and industries that the world depend upon (such as the case with Saudi Arabia's oil or China's manufacturing industry providing the world with cheap goods we all take for granted) and also these regimes don't care about public opinion, which they could leverage along with their economic advantages to strong arm countries that defy against them. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau was morally right to call out Saudi Arabia but he eventually backed away when no other countries stood behind him. This says a lot just how crucial maintaining relationship with Saudi Arabia despite being an authoritarian monarchy.

Namely that if the president dies in office, the vice president gets sworn in, if he/she is also dead or unable to serve the the Speaker of the house is sworn in, etc on down the line. If someone in the line of sucession is ineligible due to the requirements of the constitution they are ""skipped"" and it passes to the next person in line.

I've recently watched two different TV shows that both deal with the complete destruction of the line of succession and the aftermath. Designated Survivor (Netflix three seasons, show is complete) in which the entire government is wiped out in a terrorist attack except one guy, the secretary of HUD so he becomes president, and Y- The Last Man (Hulu early in the first season but based on a graphic novel series of the same name from the early 2000s) in which all males on the planet die so the highest ranking eligible female known to be alive becomes president.

In both shows it is pretty quickly revealed that someone else survived, in Designated Survivor the other survivors were behind the new president in the line so it's slightly irrelevant because even if they had known about these survivors he still would have became president. In that show the new president was sworn in almost immediately, within the same night of the attack. What would they have done if they later found out one of the other survivors out ranked him and ""should"" have been president but he'd already been sworn in? This is never dealt with in that show since it didn't happen in that story, but it's the exact scenario In Y- The Last Man, one survivor was unaccounted for and someone behind her was sworn in. The show is only a few episodes in, but other than explicitly talking about how it's going to be a conflict they haven't yet dealt with  what the legal chalanges would be.

Semi related question, if it's a terrorist attack or other major loss of life in which we can't even be sure how many or which people are dead like in Designated Survivor what kind of time line is there for swearing in a new president? Does everyone in front of the sixth person in line have to be *confirmed* dead to get sworn in? In the show the capitol building is bombed during the state of the union  and realistically many of the bodies would literally never be positively identified and it may takes weeks to indisputably prove everyone else in line is dead. At some point you just have to assume a person who was in the building when it blew up and hasn't been seen since is dead.

Obviously both of these shows will attempt to handle such matters realistically but they are still fiction, so what would be the actual steps taken if someone was sworn in as president when by the constitution someone else should have been? There are rules to unseating the president so I can't imagine you just call ""do-over!"" This would obviously get extremely messy especially if congress and or the ""real"" president are of  a different party than the person sworn in. Would it take an ""impeachment"" or would the previous swearing in be annulled and the  ""proper"" president just get sworn in later? It seems like if there's no other new line of succesion and the new president recognizes the error and willingly abdicates  the office should pass to the previous cabinet member, but would it? or would it fall into a limbo of ""well now there's no president at all, so congress appoints one"" ?

For exemple, Trump is banned from Twitter while T-bans from Afghanistan can still post on the platform. Back to the main subject, Science has always questioned its surroundings to find explanations, otherwise Science would never evolved. In this case, YouTube plays the same role as the Church with Galileo and conspiracy theorists are quite happy with that. I think YouTube shouldn’t take action about this issue because for exemple people who believe in conspiracy theories see the removal of their videos as a validation of their « theories ». Therefore it has the opposite effect that YouTube intended and conspiracy theorists will just go on other platforms and conspiracy theories will keep spreading.

* Support law and order, and against mass illegal immigration. For strict prison sentences (opposite to my country) but not sure about death sentences.
* Guns should be illegal in every country over time (not for police) but i would probably own a gun if i lived in the US today.
* Atheist.

They seem to have this obsession with the government having ""power"" or ""control""; their rhetoric suggests the Left/liberals/""government"" pursue acquiring power for the sake of acquiring more power—like some kind of cartoon villain.

Despite this at least rhetorical paranoia, they persist in:

* Campaigning for the public to elect them to positions of governmental authority
* Holding office
* Exercising the levers of government power
* Fawning over the most concrete manifestations of governmental power: the police and military
* Attempting to impose their own controlling, freedom-reducing policies

One imagines they perceive a world where government officials are smashing through the doors of everyday citizens late some stormy night, strapping them down, and injecting some random substance into their bodies, cackling maniacally between thunder claps. The rest of us see something more like workplace health and safety regulations requiring people handling food to wash their hands or get vaccinated against smallpox or polio.

Where is this coming from? Isn't this the very same government we all vote for to, you know, enact laws in the interest of the common welfare, not some hostile invader bent on exploiting everything they can?

What motivates this paranoid rhetoric? From what I can tell, they and/or the primarily rural-to-exurban conservative base they're trying to speak to could be:

* Actually suffering from conditions impacting mental health: They sound paranoid because they are paranoid. Some of the fringest right-wing pundits spout ideas that sound almost schizophrenic (Alex Jones being a prominent example). Psychodynamic theorists consider frequent use of ego defense mechanisms like projection, splitting and idealization, grandiosity to be signs of borderline- or psychotic-level  personality integration/maturity.
* They have some kind of kink about being dominated (not to kink shame), and so it's always on their mind: the tyrannical government of King George III shoving its big black boot down their throat.
* They only accept the concept of negative liberty and dictates backed by their religious authorities.",True,False,False,Askpolitics,t5_2s5s2,2412,public,top,self,Wherefrom This Paranoid Style in U.S. Conservatism?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Askpolitics/comments/pprbet/wherefrom_this_paranoid_style_in_us_conservatism/,all_ads,6,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'DznG-Fup3rthz4WCIIj2HS2ayduhWMmWPBDrCdrCBHg', 'resolutions': [{'height': 108, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Kkn_zHTBN-vpSIUZXRJL-_HtMja5y5Cmp3IgPuGkCQ0.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10c63e6c6b3373f6257ab839a44caa204f466a54', 'width': 108}], 'source': {'height': 140, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Kkn_zHTBN-vpSIUZXRJL-_HtMja5y5Cmp3IgPuGkCQ0.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=e9ac92efc0572f8327df8461fb3381c98230bdcc', 'width': 140}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

People learn new information at different rates and it takes a significant amount of time for corrections to any information to fully reach the majority of the public. With the ivermectin debacle the FDA and CDC had to make public statements to stem the tide of official information sharing 6 months after corrections were made.

Over sharing information leads to varying degrees of confusion and misinterpretations as the information conflicts with each other.

At least it seams to be rare in the West. What should I label myself as?

&amp;#x200B;

\-I have nothing against the free market in theory, as long as the economy at large serves the greater good of the nation: free hospitals, free (though meritocratic) education, affordable high-quality public transport, social housing etc. All strategic industries should be under tight government control though.

\-I dislike outsiders (ethnic and cultural). I am against migrants and want to live in an ethnically and culturally homogeneous society. I believe that everyone should conform to the basic cultural norms of the society.

\-I detest most religions and can't take people who believe in a god in the 21st century after we have gone to space seriously. Most religions are against human nature. 

\-I believe that any and all sexual perversions are unacceptable and should receive zero tolerance. I can't believe I need to say it but homosexuality is a disgusting disorder that shouldn't be discussed in a polite society. Transgenderism is a very dangerous self-destructive disorder that should elicit a forced hospitalization. 

\-No feminism or whatever. I support healthy families.

\-Veganism and the like should NOT be encouraged. People should eat meat and stop humanizing animals.

\-I am not a fan of democracy, let alone of ""democratic values"". Democracy is a tool, not the end goal itself as it is often depicted. It also relies on the intelligence of the voters, and considering that the average IQ of a voter is 100, people are stupid and will make stupid decisions. At the very least, I don't want the supreme leader of the nation to be elected directly by the people, since there is nothing more dividing than having to choose who would lead you. It is fine when a ruler is elected in a landslide, but what if the winning candidate recieves 51%? That makes the other half of the population automatically disenfranchised.

&amp;#x200B;

What am I? What should I call myself? I usually refer to myself as a SOCIALIST since I seem to support a form of market socialism along the lines of Scandinavia, but in the West that word seems to imply the love for migrants along with homosexuals, feminists and other ridiculous brands of non-conformists that leach of the larger society.

I have been called a FASCIST before, whether out of kindness or as an insult, but that doesn't seem to fit my views either. From what I have read, fascism seems to reject the concept of human nature, and I believe that all decisions must be made accounting for the evolutionary psychology and basic instincts of humans. Fascism also seems to imply complete obedience to one leader, and while I do believe in strong, stable leadership, at the end of the day, the leader should serve the people not the other way round.

I am not a NAZI either since I don't believe in any racial theory or any form of intrinsic superiority. I am a nationalist for my people for no other reason that I happened to be born among them.

What am I?  Conservative socialist? Patriotic socialist? Social fascist? Social Nationalist?

And when we leave, you're going to leave us alone, and we're going to leave with great dignity and great honor. And we are going to take care of this situation. We're going to take our time.

You take a look at when they started taking over Afghanistan. It's when I left. When I left, that's when it started, they started going wild, because they were dealing with another president. And I never realized, and of course I realized the importance and power of the presidency, but I never realized how important the office of the president is until this happened, because when I watched what happened over the last week and a half with some horrible, stupid decisions that were made, number one being allowing our military to leave before the civilians and before we get all of our equipment back, $83 billion dollars.

Given that the Taliban is clearly a hostile group that cannot be trusted to value life, and given that we've essentially been at war with them for the last 20 years, how does the act of giving literal lists of what amount to targets to the Taliban not amount to outright, official treason?

The formal definition of treason according to the United States Legal code is:

&gt; Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.

As such, a plain text reading of this provision would seem to indicate that whoever prepared and distributed such lists would be giving aid to the enemy, given recent events.  Barely more than a week ago, Biden was on the record as saying that a Taliban takeover was impossible, and now not even a week later, we're behaving on an official level as though they're allies, which is absurd to a preposterous degree.  If Biden was involved on any level with the decision regarding these lists, is he not also roped into this as well?

The US Union can't force the states to do lots of things and American states have lots of liberties. They all need to democracies, they all need to be republics and so on.

As far my understanding goes and I know that it could be a good case for the US Supreme Court, but most certainly a law like this would be unlawful by the US Congress. Most certainly, the states have the right to restrict the deployment of renewables.

Anyway, without digging deep in the discussion about renewables, my question is: is there a state that is so federalist that a law like Indiana's would also be unlawful? Is there a state where counties have no rights whatsoever and are just administrative divisions (like unitaries states in Europe, like Spain).

I would probably guess that California gives its counties more liberties than Maryland. But it's just a guess.

Additionally I know that Blinken has no problem working with any sort of fundamentalist extremist, salafis in Syria most famously, also his plans in Libya, etc. Iran has known the Taliban would take control for years, they've been preparing for that inevitability since at least the Obama administration which again makes me think of Blinken since he was integral in the Iran deal- I can't imagine he is not in conversation with Tehran about all this now.

I  know Black lives Matter, as an  organization, only really started in  the early 2010s. But that was still  several years of campaigning and  being a group. Overall when I type it  in I see that its always a  justification or defense of Obama.

Rarely do I [see articles](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2017/1/27/obama-and-black-lives-matter-an-epilogue/) that [criticize](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/07/21/how-president-obama-failed-black-lives-matter/)   Obama in some extent for not doing enough for what would be modern day   civil rights activists. When I read some of the articles they only  serve  as empty platitudes which emphasize how Obama was all words but  no  actions.

Now this isn't a defense against Trump (or even Biden). Both men (yes [also Biden](https://i.ytimg.com/an_webp/YD7NYwpbGOk/mqdefault_6s.webp?du=3000&amp;sqp=CI2Q6YgG&amp;rs=AOn4CLD3fIVbiMWGflN311O9vg8eAG1alA)

)   have a history of supporting racist policies that harm or push back   against what the African American community advocates and pursue   policies that, overall, are harmful to minorities. Biden may give some   semblance of progress but only when he is [forced](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-pandemic-has-pushed-biden-to-the-left-how-far-will-he-go/) to.

And this isn't a defense against Black Lives Matter either. The movement itself has proven to very hostile to [Asian](https://www.reddit.com/r/aznidentity/comments/p5143h/black_activists_furious_illinois_passes_law/)s   as a whole which I find reeks of hypocrisy. Overall I detest the group   for this very reason as I feel this quote basically summarizes my   feelings:

&gt;Do or don't. There is no otherwise

If those are you values then you live them whole heartingly every day. If they are not then don't say so. Still my point stands.

As I understand it, many people are against mask mandates because they ""don't want to live in fear"" and feel that a mask mandate ""impinges on their freedom.""

However, I would presume if you asked a conservative if those statements come to mind when considering...

* the requirement to have headlights while driving
* the requirement to have a driver's license while driving
* the requirement to stop at red lights
* the illegality of drunk driving
* the stupidity and illegality of pulling a gun on a police officer unprovoked and out of the blue
* the illegality of punching a random stranger on the street
* the illegality of pouring sewage on a random stranger on the street

then they would not believe these government safety measures to be living in fear nor impinging on their freedom.

What's the difference? From a liberal point of view, masks are far less intrusive and more life-saving than the majority of the above bullet points. Is that solely where the contention lies?

Of course, these are caricatures of the two most extreme definitions, but you get the point. Looking up the definition of liberal gives a broad definition that talks about supporting equality before the law and freedom, something which no normal person would be opposed to. Strangely, however, very few people that know about politics would ever call themselves a liberal. ""Liberal"" almost always carries this negative meaning with it.

The Conservatives currently holds a comfortable majority, and the opinion polls are not saying that the Conservatives are looking any likely to avoid gettting most seats in the next election as well.

But polls now are different than from 3 years when the next election arrives, and so I have wondered how far parties will go stop another Tory government

So I made a scenario. The next election gives you this

    Conservatives: 310 
    Labour Party: 240 
    SNP: 49 
    Liberal Democrats: 21 
    Sinn Féin: 8 
    Greens: 6 
    Plaid Cymru: 6 
    Democratic Unionist Party: 5
    Alliance Party: 4
    Social Democratic and Labour Party: 1

Here Labour Party needs 86 seats to form a majority and could get 49 from SNP, 21 from Liberal Democrats, 8 from Sinn Féin, 6 from Greens and 6 from Plaid Cymru, leading them to 330 seats. 

Now the thing is, I am aware that the UK is not used to coalitions. Therefore, I wanted to hear whether you think that there is any possibility that a coalition suddenly includes 6 parties?

And if there are, then some issues might erupt looking into some of the parties.

For SNP, I get the idea that they don't like Labour, and it's reasonable to think that the SNP would tell both Conservatives and Labour that they needed to promise a refrendum to gain their seats. So what if the Conservatives are quicker to announce that they will giving such a promise, would the SNP then hesitate and wait for Labour to give them the same opportunity, or just take the Conservatives offer.

For Liberal Democrats, even though they are probably centre-left, would they really prefer supporting Labour instead of Conservatives, if it meant they would be 1 of 6 powerful parties instead of 1 of 2.

For Sinn Féin wikipedia lists them as Abstentionist which I don't know what mean.

For Greens, I guess they would love their chance

For Plaid Cymru, I wouldn't think they would see much downside of it.

&gt;Making the regulatory process more interdisciplinary not only brings  greater diversity of perspective to the process but also can bring more  voices. Checks and balances are an important avenue for reducing  capture. Does anyone doubt that capture would be even more likely if we  had just one house of Congress instead of two?  
&gt;  
&gt;The same holds for the regulatory process. On a positive note, the [Office of Management and Budget](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb) (OMB) and the [Council of Economic Advisors](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/cea)  (CEA) have successfully brought more checks and balances to rulemaking.  The importance of diffuse decision-making should also lead us to prefer  multi-member commissions over single directors when considering the  structure of independent agencies. Forcing greater deliberation can also  help avoid so-called cognitive capture and other behavioral biases that  often plague regulators.

IDK, maybe people in America writing the narrative are referring to something different when using the terms ""culture war"" or ""cultural war"", but to me a cultural conflict is in place when social phenomena normalized by culture are being questioned to a point where firm advocates of that culture are actively defending it.

Mainstream western cultures (note the plural use of the term please) are often problematic normalizers of very opressive things like racism, sexism, classism, neoliberal economy, aporaphobia, LGBTIQ+ discrimination and so the list goes on. So yeah, you bet I'm against a culture that does that kind of stuff. That doesn't mean I can't enjoy a game of my national sports team or celebrate christmas with my family, to put a few examples of something of my culture that I do like. Cultures aren't like membership clubs, no-one gets to decide what anyone else can or cannot do with it. No-one owns a culture, let alone be entitled to dictate how people under it are supposed to behave unless you're screwing people over – but I shouldn't be surprised to see that being a hard concept for many westerners to wrap their heads around, because prioritizing ownership over human rights or dignity is a **such** western thing to do.

There's 2 problems currently.  

1) It's a nonpartisan election (meaning no primary, everyone runs in the general), so there can be anywhere between 2-8 people running for a single spot. Most online trainings say to shoot for 55% (presuming a 2 person race), but last cycle this office had 5 people running and the winner only took 25% of the vote. Many of those people running only announced a couple months before the election. Is there a standard way of prepping my candidate as to what the vote goal should be in this environment?

2) An equally big issue, this race was originally in a city that had city wide races for this position until 2018, at which point they broke the city into districts for each locality to vote for their elected official. This means I'll only have 2018's vote data, so I'm uncertain how much good that'll do me.

The minimum cost of living in the US is roughly 10k a year, so unless you're in the top 40% the government pays you 7 or 8k, which is enough for you to barely survive but not enough to support a family or have luxuries like internet or the money to be able to get luxury food or buy shit which promotes jobs and work. So while work is not compulsory, it is a necessity. It helps the bottom 2% not starve to death while letting them have opportunities for themselves. Like a mix between capitalism and communism, taxes are ofcourse present but progressive and don't take literally all you make. The money here comes from taxes, like in capitalism everything is taxed, say you get payed 8k, a part of that is gonna be taxed. One problem that would come up here is that smaller countries wouldn't be able to have that much efficiency with the system, since purchases would be low and they wouldn't be able to generate enough funds in taxes. Thus the system would work better internationally, so instead of for example take country A which has 20 people. So the government is paying 160k to the citizens each year, but it isn't able to make the 160k back due to the lack of income being generated in the country. The average American made almost 70k a year in 2019, now to do some math-

78,000*20
1,560,000 (total income of all residents)
1,560,000-160,000 (total income - what the government is paying) =1,400,000 (total income after tax)
1,400,000/20 (total income after tax divided by citizens)
=70k 

So the money needed will be payed back, and the citizen is paying an 11% tax, they'll ofc have to pay more than that because the government needs money to build roads and provide for the citizens a̶n̶d̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶s̶e̶c̶r̶e̶t̶l̶y̶ ̶s̶p̶e̶n̶d̶ ̶o̶n̶ ̶l̶u̶x̶u̶r̶i̶e̶s̶ This would obviously have a lot more complications in actual countries. Hence I propose, instead of a country based system, a continent based system.
While each country is ruled and regulated. The money comes from a continental government. The system is not perfect, it does have flaws, but there is not, and will never be a system that will have 0 flaws, I simply propose an idea better than capitalism and communism. While flawed, it is less flawed than the existing systems

This will give people more confidence in trying different ways of making money, starting their own business or something, because they know that even if it fails, they'll still have money to afford the basic needs in our society, you can't just open your restaurant for example, because in case it fails, you'll be left without income, and quite possibly with debt, so with the system I suggest, people would always have a feeling of stability, knowing that they'll be always able to afford the necessary things

While both were products of a wide array of nation-specific problems, each can be attributed to economic and/or political turmoil. 

So, historically, one would say polarization is a product of turmoil, not prosperity. 

However, I lose this questions for two reasons:

1) There are effectively two sects of polarized political movements that appear to be supported by large swaths of the populous, at least in the US. Historically, this is not common place. 

2) Rampant misinformation in the media that is not caused by the state. In the past, misinformation tended to be as a result of government meddling. Today, misinformation is consumed because there is an economic incentive for businesses to create/propagate it. 

Therefore, I am curious whether modern hyper-polarization is a result of prosperity: there is no common or overriding enemy so we make ones of each other.

I believe in all drugs decriminalization (hope I spelled it right) and I frequently use marijuana 

I strongly believe guns should be free to circulate and there’s should be just a little background check to see that you are not a criminal or an insane person 

I strongly believe in public healthcare and education, I like the government only when it works for the people. 

I think taxes are necessary for a functioning society, but they could be lowered by a lot if the government only spent them on things that actual benefits people, some services should be privatized, and some taxes, are useless because they aren’t useful for the people, like bombing kids in Syria. 

I believe in free trade, everyone should be free to sell and buy everything they want as long as nobody was hurt in the process 

I think the NAP (google it if you don’t know it) is a good system 

I believe in open borders and gay marriage (and every other lgbt right) I’m obviously not racist against no one, except for mosquitoes. 

I oppose political correctness when it isn’t needed, PC is necessary in like kids stuff, cause it’s meant also to teach things, I “oppose” cancel culture even if I think it’s mosto of the times overblown by the media, and it always existed is some way. 

I’m a bit uncertain on minimum wage but it depends.

To no surprise, he was VERY passionate about Janet Reno and the US being wrong about sending Elian back to Cuba with his father. 

His view was that Elian's mother was the sole custodian for him and made the decision to come to the United States, ultimately dying in the process. I don't think it can be debated that her wishes for Elian were for him to grow up in America and not Cuba. 

Of course, when the mother died, she no longer had parental rights, and Janet Reno felt that the law stated the father should be the guardian of the child. 

I'm sure we all remember the photo of Elian being pulled from a closet at gunpoint by federal agents. I did some research and found that Elian is quite the Castro loyalist. Even going as far as saying that he isn't religious, but if he were to worship a god, it would be Fidel Castro. Of course, Elian now says he wanted to be in Cuba and agrees with the US government decision to send him back. 

You can make a very strong argument that had Janet Reno not made the decision to send him back to Cuba, Cuban-American voters in Miami would have stayed loyal to Democrats and Gore would have won the 2000 election (then all the snowballing effects from there on out). 

So, what could Attorney General Reno have done differently? She was very clear about her interpretation of the law and custody rights going to the father.

From what I can understand the Taiwan problem was the result of a civil war in China.

As the time passed the new generations born on Taiwan were becoming more and more anti-PRC and anti-unification and it culminated in modern Taiwan population who consider themselves an independent state and it seems like everyone pretty much supports Taiwan against 'evil' and 'aggressive' PRC. However it we project this situation on US' history, who also had a civil war - would the modern US government and US population tolerate and recognize the independence of let's say Long Island if it was occupied by confederates who fled there after their defeat in civil war? I'm not familiar with US geography so I couldn't find an island that would be of same importance to US as Taiwan is to China, so feel free to correct me.

I want to preface this by saying a few days ago and several years ago, I lost my big brother in Kabul. That is why I ask this. I wish I could have known his thoughts.

So, it's a complex topic, but in short the CIA and US military openly supported fringe fundamentalist Jihadists in the Socialist Afghan country which was seen as a Soviet puppet-state. These fundamentalists were angry with the taxes, the federalization, the egalitarianism (women were given rights), and so on.

They did this with supplying everything from weapons to training to funding, and eventually schoolbooks and everything required to make a government in the 1980's. Notably, Green Berets (American Army special forces, known for being highly educated, taught to speak native languages, and train native forces) on horses fought, and eventually the Communist government asked the USSR to intervene - When this happened, the USSR attempted to use armored vehicles and helicopters, so the U.S. began providing anti-tank weapons and even STINGER missiles, anti-aircraft rockets.

[The signature look of Osama Bn Laden](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/08/03/osama-bin-ladens-mom-childhood-radicalization/900437002/) was literally an American military jacket given to him in 1980. [He was referred to as an ""Anti-Soviet Freedom Fighte](https://www.businessinsider.com/1993-independent-article-about-osama-bin-laden-2013-12)r"" in American media The ending credits of Rambo 3 [were dedicated to Al Qaeda and the Mujihadeen.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieDetails/comments/6kpif6/at_the_end_of_rambo_iii_the_credits_used_to_be/) The entire movie literally depicts a Green Beret supporting them.

The other symbol Bin Laden used a lot was an AKS-74, a cut-down AK only given to Soviet armored vehicle crewmen, pilots, and special forces - It's basically a symbol of pride. I just wanted to add that. He's using it as a trophy.

So, I mean, if you fight there as a soldier, or fought there in the past 20 years, you could be fired at with a weapon supplied by the U.S. military decades ago, by terrorists given institutional knowledge by the U.S. - If you actually read Bin Laden's writings, he's saying he's pissed that the U.S. used them as a proxy force, he's pissed Muslims are being massacred by NATO, and he wants revenge.

But at the same time I've seen a lot of equally rural areas elsewhere that weren't particularly progressive. I currently live in Seattle, and I've spent a lot of time in both Washington and Oregon, as well is British Columbia and Alberta. Both countries have extremely progressive cities (Seattle, Portland, and Vancouver), while they also have plenty of pretty conservative areas (Eastern Washington, Eastern British Columbia, and just about all of Alberta).

Off hand I know that they're pretty progressive when it comes to legalizing marijuana, as only a handful of countries (Canada included) have made it fully legal, while multiple states have legalized it completely (the federal government is largely under the control of states in the regions I mentioned earlier). Another one is granting citizenship to everyone born within our borders, which is almost unheard of in Europe.

Also there are plenty of people who support universal healthcare, affordable college, (myself included), and many other social and economic changes like the ones that other countries already, so it's not like everybody's content with the status quo (again the federal government is being held hostage by the ultra conservative states).

Also the Dems seem to be pretty good about abortion and gun control, despite their numerous shortcomings elsewhere (I'll admit they aren't a particularly progressive party, maybe center left on a good day, which is why I always vote Green). And same sex marriage was allowed only a little after the average for all other similar countries, only a few years after most of them and a few years before some (again Canada was an outlier, not the norm, also many states allowed it years before the federal government did).

What I've noticed is that the people are pretty mainstream when it comes to social issues, while the conservatives tend to be holding us back on economic issues particularly (although they're behind on a lot, they aren't able to stand in the way of same sex marriage quite the same as they can with universal healthcare or climate action). Meanwhile the liberals (I'm referring to the people, not Biden/Obama/Clinton/etc type career politicians) are pretty much in line with progressives from any other country.

In India for example, the Hindu majority grew after partition and it allowed for a secular Congress to rule the country for decades. As Whites in US kept decreasing in percentage, we are seeing a gradual decrease of percentage of White liberals and support for very pro-White leaders amongst the community.

I’ve decided that I want to read, interpret and compare a selection of philosophical and political books and write a lengthy comparative essay describing how each of these books influenced my personal philosophy and how they differ.

The books I’ve chosen for this are: 

Gender Trouble by Judith Butler

Beyond Good and Evil by Nietzsche 

The Genealogy of Morals by Nietzsche 

The Foucault Reader by Michel Foucault

History of Western Philosophy by Bertrand Russel

The Coming Revolution: Julius Malema and the Fight for Economic Freedom by Janet Smith

Women, Race and Class by Angela Davis

An Anatomy of Fascism by Robert Paxton


I’m still a bit confused about how I’ll be able to link these books together. I also have a feeling that I should rather focus on one category in particular- this selection seems quite broad to me. I’m from South Africa, so maybe I could write in a Post-Apartheid context? On either philosophy or politics?

I haven’t read much philosophy before, but I’ve accumulated a fair knowledge of politics. I’m wondering how I could link the two together? Or if I should rather focus on one. I feel that philosophy would be much easier to write personally about than politics.

I’m still in high school, so I haven’t had much experience with this kind of writing and comparison, apart from the occasional history essay. The main reason I’ve chosen to do this is because I want to broaden my understanding of philosophy and the politics of my country. A secondary reason is that I’m considering doing a degree involving philosophy and politics.

Thanks for your suggestions in advance!

Meanwhile in AZ that freak show is hitting the rails. They have already concluded that dominion machines were NOT changing ballots and the state is realizing that the way they are conducting the recount is so bad that they are already talking about doing another recount, but this time by an independent and professional company. Not only did they waste weeks looking for watermarks and bamboo in the ballots, but now they arent going to add any ballots that THEY deem ""suspicious"" into their final count.

In GA the trump supporters won a lawsuit to access their ballots. Only they arent allowed to touch the originals, they say they will send copies to experts to check the ballots authenticity. How can you check if a ballot is real by looking at a copy? lol

No other states are considering a recount in a serous manner. Sure some state republicans, the ones that will be running for re-election soon, will play games and hint at recounts until they are reelected.

The trump supporters, having no understanding of basic civics, think that if enough fraud is discovered that it will cause a new confirmation and trump will be sworn in and put biden in jail yadda yadda.

These are mainly on foreign policy, (I don't really want to delve into it, but I take a stance that is fairly hawkish, but completely loathes how Bush handled foreign policy and ruined the image of the ideas at stake. As well as completely misunderstood the trade off and neccesities of keeping the policy popular) and fiscal policy, (something that is even more unpopular than my foreign policy, like entitlement reform, and balancing budgets. Something that not even Reagan did). I don't however, like being partisan- and hate how tribal it has gotten, and have real concerns with how it pertains to democracy. Also, online politics has gotten pretty cringy and childish, (you have to realize most of the popular idealogies have younger communites, like populists and progressives, my ideas and interests are probably more in line with folk who skew older, tame, and lame) I suppose it is because I'm more of a pragmatist than anything else- but I'm about ready to throw in the towel. That's not to say I won't associate locally or even at the state level, but national politics is just a grim reminder to me that I'm no longer the target audience. I can contend with a decent portion of partisanship, (you have to realize it's fundamentally a caveat of democracy) but otherwise my ideas are despised by both coalitions and every third party. It doesn't help that the GOP's main support is derived from voters who don't support anything I am a proponent of- and this has been going on for decades, ([look at any state TREND- not swing map going back to 2000 and see where GOP support has gotten stronger and weaker in and you'll see that my ideas have been on borrowed time from the 90s](https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2020&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0&amp;f=0). I think that considering what most people in the country want, that neither side wants me in the game now, that I really should stop fighting the winds that have been building up since 1992. I'm never going to win, and I am only causing issues in a side that has been disassociating with me since 2000. And I don't have disdain for that- it's democracy after all. If the party wants to cater to its base that's been naturally gravitating towards it for the last quarter century, and stop trying to make a play for a group that has been doing the opposite in the same time frame, (suburbs) is it really the party's fault? If my faction failed to convince or have power in the party for nearly three decades, what does it say about the ideas? I don't want an argument- I know there is no point in fighting the majority of all sides at this point. I just want an honest opinion.

Here is my, probably too simplistic take: As far as I know, the issue is with Palestine wanting territorial and political (thus general) autonomy as a country, and Israel doesn't want that because ""it is our land"".
  
My stance: If any community/province/city/county wants autonomy, and votes and referendums in the community prove that a majority want to have their own country, and they are able to create a legal and political apparatus to run the country, what kind of historical/juidical/religious reason can there possible be to stop them from doing that?
  
I don't get it. I think the issue should have nothing to do with either terrorists or Jews, with religions, history or economics. It is simply a question of the autonomy of a community of humans, which I believe is far more important than economic or historical issues, I think it is a basic human rights issue.

it too harms vital organs and inebriates the user... and yet, we even encourage people to do it outside of their own homes, with bars and nightclubs built around destinations of consumption, with little to no regard of sufficient public transportation to and from those locations.

I've heard about college professors being sacked for expressing their opinion on a controversial topic. Some say that this is an infringement on freedom of speech, others doesn't. Those who doesn't say that you're only protected from freedom of speech from authorities (The US state can't punish you for expressing your opinion about a topic). But in my mind this defeats the whole purpose of freedom of speech, because the exactly the same consequences will happen when people can't express themselves freely, whether or not it's the general public or the authorities who punish them. Professors/employees/people will abstain from expressing their opinion in fear of being fired, and this is exactly what freedom of speech should defend against.

Imagine a society with this ""freedom speech"", where people can't get punished FROM AUTHORITIEs by saying what they want.

I was wondering if you could help me figure out what a family member of mine is talking about in a recent FB post. They claimed Biden signed an XO that ended a VA program that allows veterans to seek healthcare from civilian hospitals and doctors “if the VA had no availability within a 30 day window...” or “if the proper medical treatment wasn't available at the VA facility...”
 
I believe the program in question is the Veterans Choice Program but am not sure. This is a program started under Obama in 2015 and expanded under Trump in 2017. I checked the federal register and cannot find any XO that rescinds the program in part or in whole. Then again, I didn’t read the entire text of every Order/Action. 

I did find a few articles expressing concern that the expansion of the program under Trump was more about privatization than about helping veterans. So perhaps the new VA director could have made some changes to the program in that light. Still, I’m not seeing anything in particular. 

Regardless, apparently my family member is left without a treatment program now because of some changes and has to start over which does suck. 

Mostly I’m just trying to understand if this is really a bad thing done by the Biden administration or if it’s one of those damned-if-you-do-damned-if-you-don’t situations where a change was made that is better for all in the long run but temporarily leaves some veterans in a bind.",True,False,False,Askpolitics,t5_2s5s2,2189,public,top,self,Biden Executive Order on Veterans Affairs,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Askpolitics/comments/mz1o7c/biden_executive_order_on_veterans_affairs/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

I've made a lot of posts here about wanting to remove my vagina, or wanting a girl to top/dom me. Both of those are things I'm actively working on. However, im still a person, I'm honestly not sure where this paragraph was meant to go. Just don't judge me. 

I've always been told right wingers we're bigoted and would want me dead for being agender or for liking girls. But I've been thinking, and I actually might be more conservative then I thought. 

Here's some reasons:

___________________________________

A- I'm beginning to get a lot of soft bigotry from my peers. They always treat me as a prop or some sort of special person just for being enby. A lot of them are weirdly soft on me and sort of treat me like a child, pulling punches and all that. At this point it just feels like a different, candy coated, form of hate. At this point I'd rather be called dy*e then soft boi. 

B- New York and America have been kind of hurt by a lot of democrats policy. Covid has been awful, and I hate the fact that I can't do things that people from Texas can. And Biden didn't follow up on a single thing he promised, we still have kids in cages and we still have drones in Iraq. 

C- I honsestly hate left wing censorship. If there's one thing I will always stand for its free speech. I hate what many call cancel culture. People should not be censored by giant companies or angry mobs, and I expected the left I knew back when I was a kid to know that. 

D- I hate the socail pressure. I feel super afraid to speak my mind around me freinds. A single slip up and I'm a traitor to the leftist cause. If I said a single thing I said here to my freind group I would be I'm physical danger. 

E- the left just seems super anti sex. That's it. 

F- I also just found myself straight up not liking socialism or gun control.

But when I delve into reading on this subject it gets confusing.

.

My understanding is that traditionally a filibuster was an attempt to stall the process of passing a law, in the house, or senate, by simply grandstanding on a subject until everyone just gives up and walks away.  It takes 60 votes to stop someone from speaking so it takes 60 votes to stop a filibuster.  One fictional example being the speech given by fake senator Jimmy Stewart in Mr. Smith goes to Washington.  In fact this one example is poly sci 101 for many Americans of a certain age as pertains to a filibuster.

. 

My understanding of the modern process is that the Senate at least has an ""agreement"" where that physical grandstanding is no longer necessary.   They now ""agree"" that someone could grandstand, therefore they ""agree"" not to pass a law unless it passes with at least 60 votes because someone opposing could filibuster if they want and nobody wants to have to sit there so the threat alone is enough to halt the process. In reality it only takes 51 votes in the Senate but they don't pass laws with under 60 if an opposing member so much as whispers ""filibuster"".

.

It seems that his intentions were thrown around a lot in this trial, but the intention was not necessary for convicting him with the charges he faced. Additionally, the judge stated in the instructions to the jury prior to jury deliberation that,   

&gt;'With intent that,' 'with intent to,' or 'intended' means that the Defendant either has a purpose to do the thing or cause the result specified, or believes that the act performed, if successful, will cause the result. **It is not necessary that the Defendant have this intent in advance; the necessary intent can develop during the commission of the act.**

**Intent is irrelevant** to both Count II of Third Degree Murder, or murder *evincing a depraved mind, without regard for human life,* ***but without intent*** and Count III, Manslaughter in the Second Degree, or *negligence* resulting in death. And as for Count I, Second Degree Murder,  

&gt;Under Minnesota law, a person causing the death of another person, **without intent** to cause the death of any person . . .

While Cahill states that ""It is not necessary that the Defendant have this intent in advance . . ."", in actuality it is not necessary that the Defendant have intent **at all** so long as it concerns Chauvin's trial. Intent, as defined, would only become relevant in the case that Chauvin was charged with First Degree Murder. Is this seeming Kafkaesque or is it just me?

I think a better and more succinct question of mine as a result of this is if Cahill's definition of intention sheds light on the hypothetical convictability in a First Degree Murder trial of Derek Chauvin. Is simply demonstrating the truth of what Cahill stated, that intention need not be in advance of the commission of the act such that intention can develop during the commission of the act, enough to show the murder of George Floyd was premeditated and convict Chauvin with First Degree Murder?

I'm a &lt;30m trying to go into politics in my country and I have up with a draft for how I want to achieve my dreams and I would like for you to maybe take a look and tell me your opinions. I didn't want to make a generic ""How do I get into politics"" post. It's more for longish term since I am in my PhD(STEM) but anyway, here is my approach.

Short term (&lt;8 months)

I am already enrolled in a political party and I'm currently in the ""expat"" division of it. Which is fine because expats have a % in the elections.
In x months there will be elections for the internal expat committee of my party which I don't intend to compete in but I do intend to profit from it. There are internal turmoils and it seems like there are 2 main ""factions"". Since I am newer I am outside the conflict so I want to play both sides feigning ignorance and trying to be as useful as I can. I don't expect for them to make me pick a side yet and the whole conflict is kinda silly in my eyes but people are anyway consumed by it.
I intend to make myself seen by joining in the discussion as objective as I can and even approaching on a pacifist path both online and in live meetings(as many as I can).
As in this period I only intend to get myself seen and noticed I don't think anyone will see me as an opponent and I will genuinely try to help the party.

Medium term (~6 years)

Again this part is for me to make a name for myself. I will be busy with my PhD and I want to leave some time for a possibility of a post-doc. I will continue to interact with people and hopefully will get a small position on the comitee just to be ""in touch"". Slow and steady like.
During this time I will start to post political things on social media and making my way to starting my own social media political presence.

Long term 

Hopefully after I finish with my studies I will have already made a name for myself and the transition from ""guy people know"" to a person ""in power"". My goal is mayor of my (important) city, parliament or higher.

Personal challenges:
Letting go of my sense of shame so I can randomly talk to people and avoid the opinions of people I already know.
Crafting my presence. It sounds cringe but I want to forge myself into a strong and calculated type. I am naturally explosive tho but in a debate I'm doing well. I've been dabating and arguing my whole life with people, mostly friendly.

My forte for the moment is that I am young and don't pose a challenge for the older generation so I can communicate better. There is also a huuuuuge generational mentality gap(due to reasons) so I will better represent my ages which are not at the moment interested in politics and voting.
I would wish in time to make a sort of vlog on YouTube and live videos on facebook to comment my activity, react to comments and news. I don't really like to reply in writing because people will drag me even more.

What if I fail? Well, this kind of experience will be a plus of knowledge anyway I look at it. I still want to make a difference, maybe I will aim lower in local university and insitute politics (dean, director..)
Anyway, there will be a lot of hurdles, I want to learn as much as I can about as many fields, just the surface is ok so I will never get cought unprepared. At the moment the politics are dominated by brute-ish yes men who talk more than the think and some smart manipulating type that usually get the high places. Things do seem to shift for the better and I guess I have a chance if I take it.

Basically he sees it as an opposite of semi-presidentialism in that instead of the executive being divided into an elected president and a PM responsible to Parliament, it is the legislature divided succinctly into 2 elected chambers with the executive only responsible to one of them. The other chamber becomes more akin to the separate legislative banch found in presidential systems. He argues that this is a way of having a strong separation of powers without the ""executive personalisation"" found in presidentialism.

It should also be noted that the bicameralism found in most Parliamentary systems do not qualify for this definition as the upper houses are largely not directly elected and lack the powers or legitimacy to exercise the functions of a proper legislative branch.

Since there aren’t many people talking in that thread, I thought I might get some answers here. I hope this is the right place to post this. I couldn’t find a decent law subreddit that actually takes current events-related questions.

[I read this article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/texas-land-border-wall-biden-b1832178.html) today. 

As someone who knows *very little* about eminent domain law, I’d like to better understand what’s going on here. I may not be able to grasp the full magnitude of the situation— but, on a superficial level at least, I can recognize how complicated it must be. **So... If you’re reading this and can give us a quick run-down on what might be happening behind the scenes, please respond!**

A new administration can’t just wipe away every single action of the old one— there are safeguards in place to prevent that (as Trump learned when he tried to repeal the ACA and other Obama-era legislation.) Even without Covid-19, tackling any of  this would take more than 100 days in office! I feel for the landowners in such an impossible position— and I’d like to know: can they fight this somehow? 

So... legally-speaking, how does eminent domain work?

 **I’m unsure of what power, if any, the new administration has to affect the outcome of cases started under the previous president.** Can the Biden Administration *legally dismiss* this case (and the 140 others still awaiting a verdict?) 
Or... because these cases have been active since 2019-2020 (and originated under a different administration,) is it out of their hands?

**Is there an appeals process for the landowners?** Can landowners form a class action, or does it have to be a case-by-case basis, (like we’re seeing now?)

Don’t governmental bodies (whether state or federal) have to file a specific reason for use of eminent domain? ( ^It’s ^almost ^always ^infrastructure-related; ^a ^new ^road ^or ^highway ^expansion, ^or ^something ^like ^that.)

**I might be totally wrong here and feel free to tell me if I am**— but, generally speaking, isn’t each stage of a plan usually mapped out (and funding 100% secured) before land/home owners are even approached about it? If a project falls through, can’t landowners fight the state/feds to keep ownership of their property? I’ve read that eminent domain is *much harder* to secure the second time. 

Something like that happened in my state a few years ago— plans for a road expansion that called for demolishing a gas station (and a few other buildings) got out too early. The surrounding buildings were empty, so their owners immediately sold off... but the gas station flat-out refused. The plans fell through... then, a few years later, the city/state got the funding sorted. They tried to pull eminent domain to demolish the gas station *again,* but the gas station challenged them and won. The city/state had to build their road expansion *around* the gas station, and include two convenient entry/exit points for them. That gas station literally sits between two major streets and the entrance to an interstate highway. 

**How specific does a government’s petition for eminent domain have to be?**

In this specific case—**does it make a difference that the federal government is no longer actively planning to build a wall across the entire southern border?**  It might be my confirmation bias speaking (due to the story above,) but since the border wall plans are so up-in-the-air, can’t landowners use that uncertainty to retain ownership of their properties... ^at ^least ^for ^now? 

**If anything I asked/said is wrong, don’t be afraid to call me out for my mistakes! When/If I am corrected by someone who knows about eminent domain laws, I’ll edit this post to reflect where I was incorrect!**

I am currently working on a topic regarding Saudi-Arabian politics.

Unfortunately, when trying to find out how the country's political system works, all I ever seem to find is 'well, it's an absolute monarchy so the king can do everything and religion is also important' which isn't exactly helpful.

There's also the Council of Ministers, local governments, branches of ministries, and other independent public agencies, at least to my knowledge, but I can't find an informing and simple explanation of the whole system and how these individual factors work together to shape the country. 

I am also unable to find a helpful graphic regarding this, although such graphics seem to exist for practically any other country ([USA](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Political_System_of_the_United_States.svg), [Germany (source in German)](https://www.pngegg.com/de/png-pkhyh), [Iran](http://nerdcrunch.com/2011/05/20/how-iran-political-system-works/), [Great Britain](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politisches_System_des_Vereinigten_Königreichs#/media/Datei:UK_Political_System.png))

Can someone help me by either explaining it to me or linking a helpful source in the comments? (Besides [this one](https://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Saudi_Arabia1.html), as I found it describes everything in detail but I still feel like I am missing the rough outline of the political system as a whole (basically what's shown in the graphics of the other countries I linked))

The people on the other side of the argument wish to have access to medical services that can terminate pregnancies.

The government, state and federal has the right to set and enforce standards of medical care. That's their jurisdiction by law.

We have the concepts of state rights, and we are free to make arraignments for interstate (and international) travel. If a pregnant person chooses to seek services that safely terminate pregnancies, they can find themselves economically fit to travel to borders where such procedure is allowed. It's a situation not too different than other situations where medical care is too cost-prohibitive to be obtained within borders.

I can’t understand how twitter are not within their right to ban whoever they choose? Twitter is a private company, who’s users have threatened a loss in revenue if, putting it mildly, people with questionable views are allowed to use the platform freely. 

In response to their potential loss in revenue (less users signing up, advertisers being concerned) twitter have taken a business decision to ban certain users which can hurt their bottom line. Surely they are well within their right to protect themselves from loss of revenue? Particularly when these users are deemed to have already violated twitter code of conduct written (in internet terms) centuries ago. 

In response to this, other sites have come in to fill in the market (parlor etc.) so options are still available regardless.

* Even after the election, Trump still had about two months to expose the conspiracy and have people locked up. William Barr didn't lock anyone up. In fact, he resigned.

Now they're just regular private citizens in retirement. How was it in their interests to co-operate with the Democrat scam?

* Trump handpicked Mike Pence and William Barr to be his Vice President and Attorney General. If these guys were deep state traitors, doesn't that make Trump an idiot?

The current proposal is presented in an effort to provide moderators with more effective tools to enforce rule 1 (""No low effort content or disinformation"") as well as remaining true to the motto of this subreddit (""Ask political questions"") and its general purpose of establishing a civil, honest and constructive debate platform.

Specifically, I propose that titles should either literally be questions, be introductory to questions that can be specified in the post body, or be generally aimed at opening debates, as opposed to statements of certainty that aim to present a definitive truth on any given political topic. Titles should make an effort to avoid terms like ""resolved"" or axiological terms like ""liberal destroyed"", ""Republicans hate \[...\]"" etc. Titles who bait users into destructive debates are the opposite of debate, which has the questioning of truth in its very core and therefore, titles that do not stay loyal to this purpose fall into the category of low effort content and are harmful for this community.

I also propose that posts that fail to respect this very basic request are promptly removed and banning is considered towards recurrent breakers of this rule, should the moderating team approve.

I hope the moderating team as well as any members of this community who wish to make this subreddit a better place find the time to consider and discuss this proposal.

Thank you for your time.

Of course, the government would have to make sure that manufacturers produce the needed supply of other vaccines.

The biggest problem I can think of is that this would disincentivize the development of future vaccines by corporations but I think this could be combated with paying a very large some for the formula, and a dramatic increase in government support for medical research.

Only recently sorta awakened to the world of politics (dtC). Maybe I don’t have all my facts straight, but from casually following the news it seems like Cuomo has been asked to resign before the investigation is even complete.

Is this standard protocol? If yes, it is standard protocol to oust politicians after a harassment [insert any misconduct/criminal act] accusation- I see a lot of ways this could be sabotaged by opposing parties or disgruntled citizens or malicious foreign entities. Could someone explain to me why we do things the way we do? 

If it is not standard protocol, what is special about this particular case that citizens and politicians alike are calling for his resignation before the “trial”? 

I’m guessing scenario 3 is the more likely answer- that there is no standard protocol and responses are different on a case by case basis. 


Also I’m curious about the *reason* that Cuomo is being asked to leave office. Is it because (a) the evidence points very clearly to his guilt, even before a complete investigation + huddle, or b) regardless of his guilt or innocence, the controversy stirred up by this event will make it impossible for him to govern properly, (c) bit of both?

It is also usually followed by the idea that there is an equally unreasonable fringe on the left, to be fair. 

However, when I look at polls, it seems that mainstream Republicans are much more entrenched in far right ideology than people are willing to accept, to the point that many conspiracy theories aren't fringe beliefs, they are becoming party doctrine. 

An upwards of 70% of Republicans believe that the election was stolen. 66% believe Trump acted totally responsibly in the events leading to January 6. 56% say Trump bears no responsibility at all for the events of January 6 and an additional 28% say he only bears a little or some responsibility. 51% say that the GOP didn't go far enough in fighting against a stolen election. 80% of Republicans believe the system is stacked against them, and a further 40% believe that violence may be necessary to fix the problems in this country. 

So my question is, where is the idea that Republicans aren't largely extremists coming from? It seems quite clear from the polls that they want more politicians similar to Trump (if not Trump himself who was recently honored with a golden statue at the CPAC convention).

## Title

Why does statute law determine the right to British citizenship, but Royal Prerogative power determine passports?

## Body

I don't know much British politics or law. When I phoned HM Passport Office, the lady told me this.  I asked her to repeat three times...certainly she said this! I Googled, and she appears correct.

&gt;The right to British
citizenship is nowadays determined by statute law, but the decision
whether or not to issue a passport is a prerogative power.

Why this distinction? If UK governments are so worried about British citizens travelling to commit wrongs, and returning to the UK after wrongdoing, then why not make the right to [British citizenship](https://www.fragomen.com/insights/blog/uk-citizenship-vs-uk-nationalities-%E2%80%93-know-your-status) a Royal Prerogative too? Then UK governments can way further control entry and exit of British citizens, because the Royal Prerogative will give UK governments more discretion and power to grant or withdraw British citizenship. 

[Right to cancel passports using the royal prerogative retained | Register | The Times](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/right-to-cancel-passports-using-the-royal-prerogative-retained-v6rt0f6bt)

&gt; The executive retained the royal prerogative power to refuse to issue or to cancel a passport issued to a person whom the home secretary was satisfied had been involved in terrorist activities.

[The Royal Prerogative](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:fsruKIdEEI0J:https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/118554/royal-prerogative.pdf+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=ca&amp;client=firefox-b-d)

&gt;### Passport entitlement

&gt;There is no statute law governing the grant, refusal of British passports, which are issued in the United Kingdom. However, certain principles apply which are as follows:-

&gt;United Kingdom passports are issued in the UK at the discretion of the Home Secretary and in overseas posts at the discretion of the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs. They are issued in exercise of the Royal Prerogative, which is an executive power that doesn’t require legislation.

&gt;There is however, no entitlement to a passport and there are circumstances where passport facilities are refused: -

&gt;• Minors whose journey is known to be contrary to a Court Order, to the wishes of a parent or other person or authority awarded custody or care and control, under the provisions of the Children Act 1989, or the Children Act (Scotland) 1995, or the Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995;    
&gt;• Where a person is to be arrested under a warrant issued in the United Kingdom or is wanted by the United Kingdom police in suspicion of a serious crime;    
&gt;• Where a person’s past or proposed activities are so demonstrably undesirable that the grant or continued enjoyment of passport facilities would be contrary to the public interest (these cases are very rare and decisions on this category are made personally by the Home Secretary);    
&gt;• In the case of UK nationals who have been repatriated from abroad at public expense, until they have repaid their debt.",False,False,False,Askpolitics,t5_2s5s2,2117,public,top,self,"Can you post this on politics.stackexchange.com, blocked by the country I'm in?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Askpolitics/comments/lt99fw/can_you_post_this_on_politicsstackexchangecom/,all_ads,6,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'u_m9lscTtEjfuDTGm71zdwlrTRxq0fQogtpgrb0v0oA', 'resolutions': [{'height': 108, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/3TL6DZ2G-cEonV7c8sQcvUokCvESnxxzIogNdwK6s70.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed6b08d365c09c63da72809735e3a95fa50e98fc', 'width': 108}, {'height': 216, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/3TL6DZ2G-cEonV7c8sQcvUokCvESnxxzIogNdwK6s70.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5cd58d954132cc2eff3bd75b748a61df02a2710', 'width': 216}], 'source': {'height': 316, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/3TL6DZ2G-cEonV7c8sQcvUokCvESnxxzIogNdwK6s70.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=466d86afe26847f3e875409bc5501367bba843e6', 'width': 316}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Quick background about me, i consider myself a moderate but more leaning to the left and more so in the last 4 years than prior.

Now i do agree that after 12 years the minimum wage needs to be increased to keep up with the 2%/year inflation rate that we see year after year. What i dont agree with is making it a set dollar amount as we all know depending on the part of the country you live in the cost of living can vary.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally i feel states should be in charge of the minimum wage price to keep its economy stable and not put small businesses out of business. I think the Federal government should instead consider changing the format from $15/hour and instead made it a percentage from the current min. wage price for the state. So for example i live in NV and on July 1st, 2021 the min. wage will rise to $9.75 from the current $9. If the fed. government instead makes the policy a 25% increase from its current price of $9, that would call for a min. wage of $11.25/hour. Now this is just an example and 25% is just a random number i chose for this example so the percentage could be anything but i'm more curious what your views on this change is and your opinions.",True,False,False,Askpolitics,t5_2s5s2,2117,public,top,self,Do You Agree With The Minimum Wage Hike In Its Current Format?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Askpolitics/comments/lsjjjc/do_you_agree_with_the_minimum_wage_hike_in_its/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

It's your favorite crazy moderator back with a new sticky...   Watch out, I might get the fever again.

More serious things...

I'm going back on my word a bit and have agreed to a heavier-handed moderation strategy as it relates to disinformation.   Sorry, ""disinformation"".

Can you tell I'm not a huge fan?  I believe in freedom of speech and I don't personally see what good removing comments (genuine comments) does and more is gained by discussing the topic and the  ""disinformation"" than just removing the conversation, but...

I have agreed to compromise a bit on a temporary basis.   The rule going forward (rule for moderators) is that we can remove direct answers to a post.  First level answers that is, not sure what to call it.

I specifically spelled out that we won't remove people that ask the question, receive an answer, and then respond with information of their own.  (There are limits just like there were before and if someone tries to abuse this by deliberately posting disinformation on off comments to thwart my rule, I'll just ban you myself)

Most of this will likely be the other moderator who I don't fully trust.  Don't worry though, I don't fully trust anyone and so far new mod had handled things in a decent way and I'm pleased.  A few comments were removed that I disagreed with which I undid, that's how this new process came about.

As mentioned, it is a temp trial run and I'll let it happen and then decide how I feel about it later.   This compromise was my idea and one I've thought about for a while.

So here's what I'm asking from you:

If your comment is removed and you feel it unjust, please send me a pm (not modmail), but, you have to do a bit of work in doing so and convince me what was removed was not disinformation.  I'm not that tough to convince if there's any question on the matter, I'll probably agree.  If I determine it is blatantly misinformation, comment will remain removed.  

To the longer-term conservative members here, just let me know if it becomes a problem.

The reports the there were inadequate police on hand prior to the riot is being investigated and some of the police officers who were there have commented, names with held to protect them from persecution. They are reporting there were not as many police on hand that day as during the BLM protests although personnel were requested. Officers were off that day but during the BLM riots all officers worked double shifts. Tactical gear such as helmets and shields were in some cases not issued and in some removed.  Former House sergeant at Arms Paul Irving and former Senate sergeant at Arm Michael Stegner were both asked for extra forces before the protest and refused the request, the resigned after the riots and refuse to comment on their actions. While videos show police trying to stop the rioters from entering the Capital, other videos show some police officers removing barriers and waving people closer to the Capital than was authorized. This action has not yet been explained. Breaking into the the Capital was wrong and inexcusable no matter you or why. Unlike many I’m waiting for the results of the investigation to lay blame, I believe that everyone who commits any act of violence no matter the reason must be punished, but everyone is innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. I completely expect to get a spew of hate for this view, many people continue to instantly hate anyone with a different opinion. But let me explain and please try to look with an open heart and mind. Any violence is wrong! Period no other answers makes any sense. People hate the KKK and it is more than justified. But think about this for one minute. Freedom of speech gives the right of those assholes to march down the street peaceful because in America to take that right away from one asshole you open the door to take it form a just cause. So imagine if they walked down the street, the police escorting them so protesters couldn’t attack them, but rather than thousands os people screaming hate, nobody was there! Not one person showed up to watch them, yell at them, there was no one there that gave a singe shit about them!!! They would look like the joke the truly are. Rather than go home and say. “See how they want to kill us! That is why we need to fight them!” They would lose their purpose. Nobody gives a dame about you, you don’t matter at all. In the reverse saying that the burning and looting during BLM protests is justified or saying that is mostly peaceful is wrong.

 I’m wondering if that’s 1) possible, 2) likely to happen, and 3) legally indicated as the “correct” course of action/an automatic or required process: 

Question: would House Speaker Kevin McCarthy ever be subject to subpoena by the DC DA to testify in criminal or civil court regarding the Jan6th riot? And secondly, if he can, should he be? Why?

I might need clarification on any relevant presidential confidentiality privileges, differences between criminal court, civil court, and impeachment proceedings, as I’m sure there are different consequences for failing to respond or testify, whether they are under oath and the consequences for breaking that oath, and any other differences in possible outcomes due to the change in setting. 

Also wondering if (and what would be required to do it) McCarthy can be subpoenaed by the senate regarding this matter at this time, if he is legally required to respond and testify, if that would be under oath with legal or criminal consequences, if “pleading the 5th” is an option in impeachment testimony, and if that testimony could be used to justify or deny further DC court subpoenas?",True,False,False,Askpolitics,t5_2s5s2,2099,public,top,self,Could McCarthy be subpoenaed by the Senate now?

The jist of it revolves around:

* Trump secured a 6-3 Republican Supreme Court, and Republican majorities on all the lower courts. All of his hundreds of appointed judges are for life terms, are young conservatives in their 30s and 40s that will last decades on the bench, and Mitch McConnell and co. felt out a lot of their feelings on the constitutionality of ""court packing"" in advance to ensure any legal challenges to it go their way in case the Democrats ever attempt to inflate the number of judges on the courts to try and cancel out the advantages.
* Trump's work with Israel and the Middle East, where he recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, moved the US embassy to Jerusalem, got other countries to move their embassies to Jerusalem like Serbia and Kosovo and struck a number of normalization agreements with surrounding Arab nations. Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have recently said that they won't be moving back the Embassy nor changing Jerusalem's status, and they both came out in support of the Abraham Accords deals. The measures won support by a margin of 97-3 in the Senate last week.
* The Trump Tax Cuts from 2017 that overhauled the US tax codes. Per the law these changes are set to last until at least 2025, and if a Republican wins in 2024, will likely go for much longer.

Obama on the other hand, while no doubt being a symbol of potential social change himself and an excellent representative of the United States and the office of the President for the world, did not leave a lot of tangible, lasting changes. Really only the Affordable Care Act/Obamacare is left from his reign, and that's been chipped away at multiple times with the Individual Mandate recently terminated and other parts facing present court challenges.

That being said, I still buy into conservative ideals of 2nd Amendment (believe in basic gun control, not banning ""assault"" weapons), lower taxes, and small government/more individual liberties, and less wasteful bureaucracy. I also believe that capitalism has a place in society, just not for certain things like healthcare or education.

I no longer identify is Libertarian because I do believe in taxation, just not how our tax money is allocated.

He noted that individuals within a state (generals, heads of state, etc.) but not states in and of themselves. I argued that's silly because those people are exercising power on behest of the state, but he insisted on the nuance.

He then went on to say ""calling a state of committing a crime it's like calling an object doing an act only possible by creatures"" and ask ""can a state make love to you? No because only people can do that.""

He even insisted that I show him an instance where States in and of themselves were prosecuted, not politicians or policy makers, *states*.

There has been a lot of talk the past few years about some of the issues the US Constitution has, one of the big ones being the very existence of the Senate. It is the belief of some (myself included) that amendments may not be enough to fix the issues and that it would be easier to draft an entirely new constitution. It is worth noting that, in a 1789 letter to James Madison, Thomas Jefferson stated his belief that a single document cannot govern a nation in perpetuity, so there is perhaps some form of historical precedence for the redrafting of the Constitution.

She is fairly popular among Republicans too so some Republicans are going to vote for her as well especially if their candidate is extreme or unpopular (Cruz, Romney etc) and because their party is completely split over the Trump issue. Before winning she would obtain some level of cross-party support (more than any other candidate would be able to). 


Once in office, it’s unlikely that she would do anything too divisive because of how moderate she is.

As mentioned in my previous post, I have been working on a couple of changes to /r/askpolitics. These are based on feedback I received from users, as well as trends I've noticed in the subreddit. I'm posting them here with the expectation they will go live next week - as always, I welcome any specific feedback, questions, or recommendations from users.

**1) Stated rule against low effort and disinformation content.**

Comments like ""lol fuck Trump"" or ""lol fuck Biden"" don't contribute to this sub. We assume questions asked here are done so in good faith, and answers should be submitted with that same mentality. As such, low effort comments like the above (including from bots) should be reported and will be removed. 

Likewise, disinformation should be reported for review and removal. Any user claiming the Pope is actually a lizard in a human skin suit should be prepared to provide sources to back up such a claim. We understand this requires a walking a fine line - any user who has a comment removed will have opportunity to provide mods with a credible source and have their comment reinstated.  

**2) Megathreads for big events.** 

In the days and weeks after the U.S. election, we saw a large influx of similar questions (e.g. what powers does the Vice President have in the Senate?) being submitted daily. In an effort to avoid that and focus conversation, megathreads will be set up for large political events. These may be planned in advanced (e.g. the State of the Union) or in response to real time developments. 

**3) Expert flair for verified users.**

In order to raise the level of conversation in the sub, we are offering users custom flair based on personal expertise, be it educational or professional. Any user is welcome to submit a request to mods with proof and the usual verification requirements (username, date, time). We are leaving the proof requirements flexible due to the reality of working in politics.

**4) Stated rule against link spam.**

We've had several reports of users spamming links to dozens of subreddits at a time. This is an issue that continues to increase across Reddit, so we're asking users to report these posts for review and removal. 

Ultimately, our goal is to address some of the concerns raised by users and help foster a community were questions and answers are asked and provided in good faith. We understand that questions are sometimes asked by users who are seeking debates instead of answers. It is not our intent to moderate against the posts as this time. However, we do expect users to be civil in their disagreements. 

Finally, thank you to those who left feedback on the last post or via pm and modmail. There are only two of us, so we rely on your reports and modmail to assist us in moderating this community.

In 2020, it was the Republicans who had the power.  They had Trump in the White House, they controlled the Senate, and they had William Barr running the Department of Justice.  If the Democrats had committed election fraud, the Republicans had all the resources they needed to bust them. So why didn't that happen?  Why didn't ""the Storm"" happen?

I hear some Trump supporters think the GOP betrayed Trump.  There is again this vague talk of a ""deep state"" hating Trump for all the things he has done.  Frankly, I don't see why the Republicans would go to bat for the Democrats. The Republicans acquitted Trump in his first impeachment a year ago. If the ""deep state"" wanted to get rid of Trump, they had a splendid opportunity right then and there.  Impeachment is a perfectly legal process, whereas election rigging is a serious crime. Better still, Mike Pence would have become President, and they could have done business as usual with him.  Instead, the swamp supposedly let the Democrats steal the election so that they could put Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in power.  Aren't those two communists? If the swamp is full of corrupt big business tycoons, why would they support a communist takeover?

William Barr, the head of the Department of Justice, said there was no election fraud. Barr is a Republican and Trump appointed him. I don't see why he would lie to protect the Democrats. I don't see what he had to gain. Now he's out of a job, he's no longer relevant in Washington. And if he is a deep state traitor as Trumpists say, then wouldn't Trump be an imbecile for appointing him?

Shit, even Mike Pence, Trump's on Vice President, refused to throw out the election result. Pence is no longer the Vice President. If the Democrats cheated, why would Pence have cooperated? It wasn't in his interests. Had Trump won the election, Pence could have been VP for another four years, instead he's now out of a job. The guys who raided the Capitol chanting ""Hang Mike Pence"" seem to think that he wanted this.

I hear Trumpists say that the swamp elite threw out Trump because he was ruining their day somehow. But from what I have read in the news this past year, the rich elite got all they wanted out of the GOP. Last year, Congress passed a $900 billion relief bill for Covid19, and rich corporations got most of that money.

If the argument is that CBS is only reporting that there are ""allegations against Kavanaugh"", surely it could have also reported that ""there are allegations that Hunter Biden's laptop contain pictures that show him smoking crack"".

But after the attack on the US capitol I've been diving in and trying to learn more and understand what it is QAnon believers think and why.

One thing I can't grasp yet, is: **How do QAnon believers distinguish ""genuine Q Drops"" from random troll posts in the same style (which is something I'm sure must happen sometimes)?**

The sources that QAnon believers cite for their claims tend to be vague, anonymous, and unsubstantiated posts. This makes it seem like any troll who publishes a video or posts on a Q chan site pretending to be an inside informer would have as much credibility on the surface as any post from the supposedly real thing.

Is there some way QAnon believers distinguish ""genuine"" intel from troll posts? Or am I giving them too much credit here and it is the case that trolls can/have posted and fooled QAnon believers into accepting their posts at face value?

If so, are there any published examples of this happening? I'm thinking of something like the [Pierre Brassau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Brassau) story where a journalist put paintings by a chimpanzee on exhibit as modern art, or the [Sokal Affair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair) where a writer convinced journal editors to publish a bogus and satirical paper.

Sorry if these are basic questions. Thanks for your patience in helping me get my head around this stuff.

Personally I have my own ideas/views on what constitutes a left libertarian's positions.  Without going to deep, it'd be maximizing the freedom of an individual while providing a foundation so a person doesn't find themselves homeless or starving and other things that mire a person in poverty. 

In the US at least, that means I'd be in favor of getting rid of authoritarian measures such as current drug laws or the Patriot act. At the same time though, providing things that can help a person to enrich themselves and not need to worry about being evicted. 

I know of Libertarian Socialism and how Libertarianism has roots in leftist ideas, such as anarchy, but using those terms is a political dead end in the US.  

Basically I want something to act as a reference for I have ambitions to run for my state senate, which would be against a red incumbent.  In my district there is a very libertarian bend, which I feel could be used since a lot of them vote R for the wedge issues of guns.

I was considering posting this to r/AskSocialScience, but realised that this sort of content likely wouldn't be permitted there, and that this is just as much a political issue as it is a social one (although I think the two are intertwined). I did post this in r/CapitalismVSocialism, but it was removed within 3 minutes. I do not know the structure this post will take, but the theme is that basically I am someone sympathetic to conservative and reactionary political opinion (including having favourable opinions of Donald Trump), who understandably seems to think I have gotten something ""missing"" about the current political zeitgeist, and I'm trying to figure out what.

A few of facts about my life, to contextualise things:

* I am a a mid-20s-year-old graduate living in the UK with a Sociology degree.
* I have lived my entire life, prior to and after university, in a city that is &gt;90% ""White British"" (according to census data). I identify now as bisexual - having originally identified as homosexual for the first 7 or so years of my coming out. I live in a working-class nuclear family - me, my mother and father, a younger brother, and a disabled half-sister. brother and half-sister are left-leaning, whereas my parents (being a bit older) are more traditionalist, but (I would argue) more politically confused (they are both Old Labour supporting, and yet also fans of Margaret Thatcher).
* I entered university in 2014 with far-left sympathies, and during my degree found my views move further rightward. My university studies landed right in the middle of both Brexit and the Trump election - and, during both, individual lecturers on my degree chose lecture sessions to not teach the syllabus, and have a lecture session to ""just talk about"" the results and process what had occurred. I recall at the time, already beginning my change in political position, I viewed such lectures as a waste of my student funding (university courses here being funded for £9000 per annum from student loans).
* I was raised secular, but post-university I even joined an evangelical church for a brief time, because I considered that their social positions aligned with my sympathies at the time.
* My earliest political awareness was around the time of Gordon Brown.

During my degree, I read a lot of sources around social theory, and found it difficult to apply to my own understanding of my lived experiences. I found a lot of other social theorists (ones who I would consider more conservative) were left off the syllabus - some even openly addressed, with statements like (as I recall from one lecture) ""Don't reference them, they aren't respected in European Sociology, even if they are in American Sociology"" (I cannot recall who the figure was - it may have been someone like Charles Murray or Samuel Huntingdon, or it may have been one of the functionalists like Talcott Parsons or Emile Durkheim; I only recall it being a prominent name in the field, and one that surprised me when they were announced).

Having an interest in online privacy, I did my university dissertation on a topic of ""self-censorship"" in a social media context. I made use of sources such as Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann's book ""The Spiral of Silence"" and Timur Kuran's book ""Private Truths, Public Lies"". I performed two-hour-long interviews - albeit, limited to university students - and, of the sample I had, the common experience I found that repeatedly came up was that of *conservative* students feeling uncomfortable expressing their views online, as well as in-person. In spite of other literature I had read, the women, ethnic minorities and LGBT people I interviewed did not provide any information directly related to feeling any sort of self-censoriousness as a result of their particular identity. This only reinforced the conservative political sentiments I had previously been coming to terms with, and led to my scepticism of the sources I was taught on the syllabus.

The syllabus has a lot of material that I found particularly egregious. There was an article referencing race, that took a quote by Michael Jackson and discussed him as being an expert on race issues. Another article was directly on fat pride, discussing the author feeling judged in a shop for their weight, imploring the obese (which I would fit into the BMI category of) to declare ""Yes, I am a Fatso!"". We also read sources around race and post-colonialism (Edward Said's ""Orientalism"", Frantz Fanon's ""The Wretched of the Earth"" and ""Black Skin, White Masks""), feminist theory (Simone de Beauvoir's ""The Second Sex"" and Judith Butler's ""Gender Trouble""), and queer theory (Jeffrey Week's ""Sexuality""). None of these were materials I could understand, in large part because they had no relevance to anything I was experiencing in my daily life, nor had any relevance to the experience of my immediate social network - rather, it seemed so completely detached to me, that I could only interpret the things described as either historical artefacts or simply things that the author had themselves constructed.

* On critical race theory, the only BME person I knew and could discuss these things with was a student from Hong Kong who became my best friend on the course. He was a free-market libertarian, and similarly so no relation between what he was reading and his own life experiences. As diverse as the university I was at was, I can only recall perhaps two or three ethnic minorities on the course, of which this person was one.
* On feminist theory, it did not match with what I witnessed in my daily life at all, even if I looked at economic data. Of all the women I knew in my social network - i.e. family and friends' families - almost all were employed, and in many cases seemed to be in higher-status positions than their husbands. Of the ones I knew well enough to ask about the issues, by all means some worked part-time but by choice and often at a higher rate of pay than their husbands. I would discuss the sources I had read with them, and got a response dissonant to what I was reading. These were all, given my background, working-class people. Later on, my own anecdotal experiences have involved working in three separate workplaces where women have made up all positions of upper management, and the majority (or all, in some cases) of lower management positions. Although my jobs to date have all been low-status, this is still very discordant from what I was taught.
* On queer theory, my own experience provided no correlation to what I was reading. I came out at a young age to my Catholic mother, and received acceptance. I received no negative repercussions from anyone in my family. I joined a local LGBT youth group in my teenage years, but of the people I had met, none had troubled backgrounds that I was aware of. During my time at university, I also dated a trans man (AFAB) for two years, who I bounced ideas off of (e.g. Judith Butler). While they were radically left-leaning, they simply did not relate to the source material I was presenting to them either. My only time experiencing abuse was once, after years of holding partners' hands in public without response, one guy took offence one time and expressed verbal disapproval.

On the more economic topics, I simply became convinced of other positions. Brexit and Trump pushed me over the edge, to believing that the Marxist interpretation of class was lacking - that, rather than representing working-class sentiment, it was intellectuals trying to *predict* what the working-classes should want for themselves while being themselves separated (whether that be in terms of educational capital, or social capital - to use Bourdieu's view of different  types of capitals) from the working-classes themselves. The exceptions sympathetic to anything left of social democracy in the UK, funnily, are mostly that of working-class (and upper-class, as I met in many cases) socially mobile students aspiring for or attending university but with little working experience, much like the background I was.

So, in regards to Trump and Brexit, all I see is largely the identified ""privileged"" from my degree - white, cis, straight celebrities etc. - being the spokespeople, and then come to learn of more conservative voices from minority communities (Thomas Sowell, Larry Elder, Milo Yiannopolous, Peter Thiel etc.) be condemned. I live in a society where the two first woman Prime Ministers - Margaret Thatcher and Theresa May - are not applauded by feminists as progress because they are the wrong type of women; a society where the death of the first woman Prime Minister after a long battle with dementia are celebrated by ""progressives"" with the song ""Ding Dong, The Witch Is Dead"". I saw all this, even from my far-left bubble, and thought ""There is something wrong here"", and that was one of the things that pushed me right.

However, long story, but I read Reddit and see that my background and views are not the background and views of the majority. I read these sources and see nothing of value; while others read these sources and can empathize with them. I see people here daily becoming more and more leftward, and I find myself understanding them less and less (despite being of a view that I myself once held).

Now I know that soonish the new president Kamala will swear fealty to her CCP overlords and communism will be achieved, all because of a blatantly stolen election.

There are many more reasonable voices (which I am sure are all nevertrumpers or RINOS), but even they seem to be sure that america is lost forever, since no republican majority is possible anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

To cement this, i learned, the democrats will:

\- pack the supreme court with judges untill there is a democratic majority again

\- form 2 new states (Costa Rica and District of Columbia) which will add 4 senators that will be democratic by default (questionable?)

\- change election laws making voting is easier and thus making it easier to steal an election.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a fourth year political science Student in University and still haven't really recieved an answer to this question. Since the United States hasn't had a female President yet this question will mostly be in regards to other countries (although you could certainly see Hillary Clinton as being right wing in some regards compared to International Standards)

I was wondering why female Leaders have a tendency to be Conservatives as opposed to Liberals. I'm from Canada and the only female Prime Minister we had albeit briefly was Kim Campbell who was a Conservative and Rona Ambrose briefly ran the Conservatives as Provisional Leader of the opposition recently. Whereas the Liberals who are the party mainly against them have never selected a female to lead their party despite being the more ""progressive"" of the two parties. Similar to this is the United Kingdom were the Conservatives have had two female Prime Ministers while the Left Wing Labor party has never selected a female to lead their party. Angela Merkel despite being considered left wing by American standards also counts as a Conservative female leader.  New Zealand seems to break this trend with having two female Labor Prime Ministers and one right wing female leader and Australia with their only female Prime Minister being from Labor but overall the trend seems to be that most Female Leaders who rise to the highest position in Government tend to be right wing. Sorry if I'm asking a bit much but I was hoping for an explanation to this trend and perhaps why Australia and New Zealand's Left seems to be more welcoming to female leaders than Canada or the United Kingdom.",True,False,False,Askpolitics,t5_2s5s2,2016,public,controversial,self,Why Do Female Leaders Have a Tendency to be Conservatives?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Askpolitics/comments/kqnyil/why_do_female_leaders_have_a_tendency_to_be/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

You can only receive unemployment benefits if you're actively searching for work, and if you get a job offer you can only turn it down for a ""good reason"". From what I've gathered, ""I don't like the work I'd be doing"" is currently not a valid reason. Would this mean that people who are out of a job could be legally forced into prostitution or risk getting nothing at all? If some exception is made to consider ""I don't want to"" a valid reason for refusing to take sex work jobs, then wouldn't that be admitting that sex work is NOT the same as regular work?

&gt;\&gt;[Modern republicanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_republicanism)[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republicanism_in_the_United_States#cite_note-1) is a guiding political [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology) of the United States that has been a major part of American civic thought since its [founding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution).[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republicanism_in_the_United_States#cite_note-2) It stresses [*liberty*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty) and [*inalienable individual rights*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_rights_and_legal_rights) as central values; recognizes the [sovereignty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign) of the people as the source of all authority in law;[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republicanism_in_the_United_States#cite_note-3) rejects monarchy, aristocracy, and hereditary political power; expects citizens to be virtuous and faithful in their performance of civic duties; and vilifies [corruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption).[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republicanism_in_the_United_States#cite_note-4)

Why does the Left defend Islam when it's religion fundamentally goes against everything Leftism is supposed to stand for? 

For context, I am a leftist. I grew up Mormon in the heart of Utah, I am now Ex-Mormon. A lot of issues that I had with Mormonism stem from Conservative Ideology. Racism, Sexism and Homophobia were all  things I encountered in the church and are things that drove me further and further left. I'm left because I believe in the working class and minorities. I've been a diehard communist since I was 15, so nearly 10 years.  


I've struggled in recent years with the way the left has decided to die for Islam. I feel like I am missing something, but (and PLEASE correct me if I'm wrong) didn't Mohammed like violently convert people to Islam in the Quran? and didn't he marry a 9 year old? Doesn't Islam permit the sexual slavery of women?   


As an Ex-Mormon I know how it's like to have people in a religion that aren't as hardline as others but if Islam is anything like Mormonism then the people who aren't as hardline still believe it on some level. As an American looking at Europe, I don't agree with the Europeans first mentality or anything against refugees. I also don't agree with not letting people follow what they want. If you're Islamophobic I don't agree with you.  But considering the terror attacks, the beheading of the teacher in France. I guess in my head Islam (like Christianity) is almost the Antithesis of the left. This question comes from a genuine place, if this isn't the right place to ask I am sorry.

In addition to the 50 states and DC, her particular proposal also includes the US territories: namely - Puerto Rico, Guam, US Virgin Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa.  

The stated goal of the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact (NPVIC) is to ""Elect the President by National Popular Vote"".  However (unlike the Boxer Amendment), the text of the [National Popular Vote Compact Bill](https://www.nationalpopularvote.com/bill-text) currently makes no provision for the territories, allowing membership and counting votes from just the 50 states and DC.  So-called ""[interstate compacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_compact)"" need not be limited to just the states; DC, Puerto Rico, and other territories are already members of one or more such compacts.  And besides, all non-member states would be unwittingly involved since their own popular votes would, presumably, also be included in the compact's official national popular vote total when the NPVIC gets activated.  

If statehood for a given US territory is not forthcoming, and that territory nevertheless either (a) attempts to join the NPVIC or (b) simply holds and publicly certifies its own popular election for president, would it be fair for the other NPVIC members to refuse to count popular votes from those particular American citizens?",True,False,False,Askpolitics,t5_2s5s2,2000,public,controversial,self,"NPVIC: Should US territories be allowed to participate, or not?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Askpolitics/comments/kkl1dd/npvic_should_us_territories_be_allowed_to/,all_ads,6,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'x-mFRDU3-kcyIOmXC3RM_UAa2Z1EZ19_pcw4l4KSz4U', 'resolutions': [{'height': 56, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/8gPxSVoppp7KipwNgOQK0WDSWvwDwOOj0vOGt47jvXY.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6313ff34e1e00c1b8df9269f49161c44abde845', 'width': 108}, {'height': 113, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/8gPxSVoppp7KipwNgOQK0WDSWvwDwOOj0vOGt47jvXY.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad5b0643112ffc3b982eefb913442a95d5ad8766', 'width': 216}, {'height': 168, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/8gPxSVoppp7KipwNgOQK0WDSWvwDwOOj0vOGt47jvXY.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f2e75362b2befaea23b7f3a7a2512638f2e10e2', 'width': 320}, {'height': 336, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/8gPxSVoppp7KipwNgOQK0WDSWvwDwOOj0vOGt47jvXY.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5021a623b61fa686593379e249d0f86a4f6df54f', 'width': 640}, {'height': 504, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/8gPxSVoppp7KipwNgOQK0WDSWvwDwOOj0vOGt47jvXY.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2310f3a426441bf9ad1a94b6675ad40f5b525ae', 'width': 960}, {'height': 567, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/8gPxSVoppp7KipwNgOQK0WDSWvwDwOOj0vOGt47jvXY.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c53f08b10fe13ef42cf4d0a1e22b8a3b090012c9', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 630, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/8gPxSVoppp7KipwNgOQK0WDSWvwDwOOj0vOGt47jvXY.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=2e70de6f3e6b6a22305389b3744a5c880b1afc28', 'width': 1200}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

I am not trying to be facetious but hoping to find objective explanations.

Without clicking the link, the states with the highest percentage of 4 year degrees also voted democrat   the last 3 elections and the opposite is almost entirely true for the states in the bottom percentage of 4 year degrees. I know you can't draw solid conclusions out of data alone, but I think it's reasonable for someone to at least draw some inferences here. How would you explain this phenomenon to an outsider who is making a comparison between state election results and their overall level of education? 

Also, its not in the chart but the top 10 states with 4 year degrees is also the top 10 with advanced degrees only in a different order.

What's the trend in articles regarding the performance of the GOP in these senate runoffs? Because the trend seems to be that the Republicans are doing way better than the Democrats in spite of boycotts against the runoffs and the depressing of voters.

They're really good at aggressive campaigning and it seems to be working. That's my concern. It's all the same. Rep senate candidates releasing highly effective attack adds against Warnock and Ossoff candidates, GOP campaigns being given campaign money from corporate sources far more greater the ones of the democrat candidates and grassroots efforts, higher republican voter turnout than democrats, supporting claims that trump won the election, etc. In short, they're winning and outperforming the Democrats of Georgia.

It's not about whether democrat voters are turning out at all, it's about the demographics and the percentage of *who* exactly turned out. Of all things, whoever wins this runoffs definitely isn't Democrat. There would be high turnout but don't convince yourself that it's mainly democrat voters. It could be republican voters outnumbering them.

This concerns early voting and the eventual general election.

I've been keeping track of articles regarding the Georgia runoffs on /r/politics and I'm currently pessimistic about the outcome. As much as I want both Ossoff and Warnock to win, I simply don't see that, judging by how aggressive the Republicans are at motivating their voter base using lies and fear to stoke them up. Sadly, their efforts are working and are far more effective than the efforts of the democrats

From what I've read and after overcoming agonizing bouts of anxiety, dread and depression from doing so, I suspect that Republican turnout to be far greater than democrat turnout. The likelihood of perdue and Loeffler winning being very high regardless of what polls or optimists say. That's my hunch and my doubts


I'm not talking about Democrat voters not turning out as much as Republican voters, I'm talking about the demographics of the political alignment of who is turning out and filling the ballots more than the other. As in a turnout of Republican voters vastly outnumbering the amount of democrat voters. Primarily motivated by anger at Trump's loss of the election. Wanting a republican senate to prevent Creepy Sleepy Joe from destroying the country and taking all their guns.


It's going to be a republican victory no matter what polls say and regardless of how many times you tell as many people and their mother to go out and vote. the republicans are that good and that efficient at stirring up their base. They are pulling all the stops to win this no matter what. They've got mountains campaign money supplied by corporate allies that they can use for aggressive campaigning (smearing the opposition, etc), their voter base in Georgia vastly outnumbering the democrat demographic, voter suppression, the fact that the governor is a republican and capitalizing on the outrage of Trump's loss by the overwhelming republican demograph of the US. The Georgia GOP is too far rooted down to be usurped by the Democrats


With a senate and supreme court controlled by the Republicans and Conservatives, Biden will be unable to carry out his agenda. This leads to Biden's presidency failing and will pave the way for the GOP to install someone worse than trump and better at hiding things into power. a failed Biden presidency will allow the GOP to justify installing this new despot as well as portraying them selves as patriots fighting against the big bad Democrats trying to destroy Democracy. And in terms of Biden tackling climate change they'll repeat trump's claim of it being a hoax and claim that the Democrats are wasting money on something that's not real.


They will win this, I assure you. Unless there is news or signs of depressed Republican votes or ""Stop the steal"" boycotts threatening the Georgia GOP's senate campaign and a constant stream of news that suggests republican victory in the Georgia runoffs, I'm not going to retract my doubts. Every news article on /r/politics pertaining the Georgia senate runoffs talks about Perdue and Loeffler campaigns releasing aggressive ads and gaining a shit ton of support, big name republicans helping in motivating way more people than big name  democrats like Yang or Stacey Abrams, republican donations, etc. The GOP is winning this.

Trump is never going to accept the results of the election. He has lost over 50 law suits trying to overturn the result of the election, his ego will never allow him to admit that he lost of his own accord and not because he was the victim of a rigged election, the embarrassment will be far too great. I also believe he is frighteningly addicted to power, he will never willingly go back to being an ordinary citizen and this evidenced by his own admissions such as when he said that he hopes one day American presidents will be able to serve life long terms, when he had a crowd at his rally chant 12 more years or even today when he falsely tweeted that he won the electoral vote.  


I know that he can and will be forcibly removed. But this seems like such a rock and a hard place situation that it scares the shit out of me. I know that the military will not support him in a coup, but you know who does support him? Over 100 members of congress, and 74.2 million republican voters. A recent poll by NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist found that 75% of republicans believe that the results of the election were fraudulent. We're talking potentially up to 56 million citizens believing that the highest executive office in the government has been compromised and that the rightfully elected leader has been overthrown, and best case scenario we just expect them to take it on the chin?  


The fact that congress is refusing to pass stimulus in the form of direct payments, combined with the resignation of Bill Barr seems to indicate to me that the general consensus in Washington is that the shit is going to hit the fan next month, so that there is no point to even try and help the American people because they know there is going to be some sort of civil unrest/martial law type situation and it will be the least of everyone's worries. And then today Mitch McConnell told republican senators in a private caucus not to challenge the election results, because "" **challenging the results would force Republicans to take a “terrible vote” because they would need to vote it down and appear against President Donald Trump.** "" The fact that McConnell feels like he still needs to stay within Trump's good grace is absolutely terrifying, the whole thing feels like an ""oh, shit"" moment, basically an acknowledgement that we have reached a point of no return. Combine all of this with the already volatile social climate in the United States because of the pandemic, and it feels like all it will take is one more molecule of water for the dam to break. 

So r/Askpolitics my question to you is this, what do you think is going to happen next month? Are you preparing for the worst?

Hello everyone, 

ThinkYoung back in 2018, conducted a comprehensive research called ‘[Millennial Dialogue on Europe’](https://www.reddit.com/r/Askpolitics/Europe.%E2%80%99%E2%80%99). After interviewing over 10,000 young people across Europe we found that an overwhelming majority felt that they were not sufficiently being engaged or encouraged to participate in decision making. 

In addition to this, Europe has transformed with technological advancements and changed how we participate in society. We had found that while public awareness of some ‘negative aspects’ of a digital world has increased, there has been very little public discord on how these can be fixed. 

We created a digital platform where young people can address their digital future in a holistic and positive way that will lead to the most inclusive digital societies.

I basically support almost every left to center-left positions: environment protection, green economy, redistribution of wealth, expanded welfare, free education, fair justice, universal healthcare and such.

However - I have some serious issues with most left parties' positions on immigration and gender rights.

1. I do believe in a humane treatment of immigrants and refugees (speaking from Italy, where the topic is \*huge\*) - however, I do not believe in totally open borders, I do think that a cap needs to be put - so immigration quotas and refusal of illegal border crossing.
2. In terms of gender rights- obviously, I'm not against women's rights, but I do believe in gender equality, whereas most left wing parties only talk about one gender issue.  
I do think that 'third wave feminism' has many issues and that men in the West do have some gender-related problems and are not the ""privileged gender"" anymore.  
As I said, I am totally for increasing equality for both genders - I have problems with considering it only a women's issue.

So - what should I vote for?

Most of the left wing electors I speak with, consider me either a conservative or a ""monster"" for believing 1. and 2.

And, needless to say, most on the right wing consider me too much left wing for believing in all the other progressive things.

Basically, businesses could apply for the wage subsidy and once approved, they would receive government funds that would subsidise 80% of their payroll expenses. The idea was that this would mean that businesses would be able to afford to keep on their staff alleviating unemployment and once lockdown restrictions eased, these employees would have money to spend at other businesses, offsetting the need for the continuation of the wage subsidy.

* The gender pay gap remains stagnant. In the US for instance, men earned $66,000 on average pre-tax in 2017 compared to women making $45,000. In 2020, it's $72,000 to $51,000. The pay gap is larger in other first world countries and of course much larger in second and third world territories, and it's expected to RISE rather than decrease in the future due to the effects of the pandemic.
* Violence against women is at it's highest rates in decades, in the US, Europe and elsewhere around the world. Femicides in particular are surging at levels rarely seen before. Some of the sources on the growing violence can be seen here [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mind-games/201909/the-number-women-murdered-partner-is-rising](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mind-games/201909/the-number-women-murdered-partner-is-rising), here [https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/us/domestic-violence-international.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/us/domestic-violence-international.html) and here [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-latam-violence-trf/rising-violence-against-women-in-latin-america-confirms-fears-of-abuses-in-lockdowns-idUSKBN23G2X6](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-latam-violence-trf/rising-violence-against-women-in-latin-america-confirms-fears-of-abuses-in-lockdowns-idUSKBN23G2X6).

* Women continue to struggle to break into high-paying male dominated fields, comprising a majority in low paying professions like nursing, teaching and healthcare while struggling to climb above 10-15% of money making jobs in engineering, finance, law or as doctors etc. An example of this can be seen in a gender breakdown of doctors by speciality [https://thedo.osteopathic.org/2018/10/men-outnumber-women-3-to-1-in-some-specialties-in-the-u-k/](https://thedo.osteopathic.org/2018/10/men-outnumber-women-3-to-1-in-some-specialties-in-the-u-k/).

**BLM/black empowerment:**

* Their stated goal of 'defunding' police departments has collapsed, with the idea not coming close to getting a majority of Americans behind it in polling [https://www.newsweek.com/81-black-americans-dont-want-less-police-presence-despite-protestssome-want-more-cops-poll-1523093](https://www.newsweek.com/81-black-americans-dont-want-less-police-presence-despite-protestssome-want-more-cops-poll-1523093) and virtually nobody doing it. The 3-4 counties that actually cut their police budgets and redirected them to other services ended up making up the costs by closing down things like their Sexual Assault and Animal Cruelty Units [https://www.foxnews.com/politics/la-police-budget-cuts-sexual-assault-unit](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/la-police-budget-cuts-sexual-assault-unit) which has soured a lot of citizens there on the idea.
* The number of fatal police shootings among black americans remains stagnant. Despite all of the protests in 2020 and in years prior, the numbers are unchanged from 2015 levels [https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2020/october/fatal-police-shootings-among-black-americans-remain-high-unchanged-since-2015](https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2020/october/fatal-police-shootings-among-black-americans-remain-high-unchanged-since-2015).

* The average black family's net worth has been falling rather than rising in recent years, with it standing at just $17,600 at the start of the pandemic and expected to fall to closer to $10,000 now. For comparison, the average white family's net worth was $171,000 at the start of the pandemic and is expected to RISE to closer to $185,000 going forward.
* Black people have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19, with them being 13.4% of the US population yet accounting for 18.7% of casualties from the virus [https://www.statista.com/statistics/1122369/covid-deaths-distribution-by-race-us/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1122369/covid-deaths-distribution-by-race-us/). This means that more than 53,360 black people have died from Covid which equates to around 1 out of every 768 black americans overall. It is by far the worst ratio out of any major ethnic group.
* 50% of black-owned small businesses have permanently shut down throughout the pandemic [https://www.forbes.com/sites/pedrodacosta/2020/08/10/the-covid-19-crisis-has-wiped-out-nearly-half-of-black-small-businesses/?sh=6ff224664310](https://www.forbes.com/sites/pedrodacosta/2020/08/10/the-covid-19-crisis-has-wiped-out-nearly-half-of-black-small-businesses/?sh=6ff224664310).

* LGBTs still make up less than 1% of all business owners and have less than 1% representation on average in government.
* Their ability to be represented more in entertainment media has recently taken a big hit with several major movie markets such as China and Russia banning or heavily restricting LGBT content and characters from screenings, thus meaning Western movies will either have to cut all such content from their own productions or make them inconsequential so they can be easily edited out for release in those countries.

To say the truth, for me, coming from a fairly homogenous European country, this practice sounds deeply racist and even dehumanising, especially to those highly talented individuals, who have made careers in their specific fields. One can hardly get rid of racism, as a social phenomenon, if race is being reconstructed every single day in the public life of a country, and even by those who call themselves „antiracist“.

Are there no discussions to finally ending this? If there is no race, biologically speaking, why even US census counts people as „African Americans“ or „Latinos“? Why is race that important to the US public life?

New poster to the sub—I hope this is the right place for this question.

It occurred to me that, considering the incredible amount of money spent on national and important state-level political campaigns in the U.S., wouldn't it be easier, cheaper, and more effective to exploit some AirBnB residency loophole or something similar to allow (for example) tens of thousands of Democrats to vote in Georgia in the coming runoff? 

Hell, it would be trivial, monetarily, for a rich Democrat to buy a few hundred rental properties in a poor, red state, fill them with sympathetic voters according to whatever the minimum legal requirement for residency is, and thereby swing every important election. It might even be profitable in the long run.

Now, not taking into account weather they are guilty of any charges or not, I'm a little confused on how would this even happen if there are no specific charges brought up against anyone yet. Now, I always thought that pardons work on a case by case basis (e.g. ""X person is pardoned for Y crimes""), that essentially the president has to say what they are being pardoned for at the time of pardon and can't just say ""X person is pardoned for any and all crimes until the end of time"".

They have different values at different stages in their lives. It is true for everyone who registered their sex as Male or Female. Piton found ~460k of registered AZ voters did not register their sex, otherwise classified as U's.

Among 5 different classifications of voter trends (Far right, mod right, swing, mod left, far left), those registered as Male had an average of 64% consistency of sticking to 1 of the 5 classifications within their lives, while those registered as Female had a 58% consistency.

Those with Unregistered sex, however, had 94% consistency of their voting trend throughout their entire lives.

So already we have that 94% of U voters vote exactly the same within any given classification, for their entire lives. Which is bullshit already, but let's keep going. Here he generalizes way too much and it took a hot fucking minute to understand what he meant, but then he proceeds to explain that the maximum number of voters in each precinct registered as U, correlated to the actual U votes in each of those precincts, is 97%.

In other words, within the U category of AZ voters, 94% vote consistently the same for their entire lives, and 97% of these U voters voted in 2020.

People are focusing a lot on the GA Senate races. I know for judicial appointments you only need a simple majority for confirmation. I also know that you only need a simple majority to pass legislative bills in the Senate. 

However, isn't a simple majority not enough for passing bills? The opposition party could filibuster and then you'd have to get 60 senators to invoke cloture. I thought this is what differentiated the Senate from the House in that it forced bipartisan compromise.

There will come a time where people will talk about Pelosi, Trump, Biden, Cheney, Bush, McConell, Bernie Sanders, Giuliani, etc... in the same that we today talk about men like Nixon, Goldwater, the Kennedy brothers, MLK, McCormack, etc... 

As a millennial, I see this future period with both flaws and benefits.

A few examples of politicians in this generation are Obama, Kamala Harris, Paul Ryan, Ron deSantis, Gavin Newsom, etc... 

I would go ahead and wager that this decade, the 2020s, we won’t necessarily see the death of all boomers but we will certainly see them leaving their positions of power.

I wished I could be President of Romania just so I can send military troops to Iraq and Syria, and exterminate ISIS, plus I want to give people good reasons to praise Sunnah Islam(the first branch of Islam after Sunnah Muslims and Shia Muslims have split) for the first time in history, and I want to prove that I am just rust and righteous ruler, and that is because I'm also Romanian Sunni Muslim by ethnicity and I have Romanian citizenship. 

My intention of becoming the future President of Romania, is so I can strive hard to prove that Islam does truly teach tolerance and justice.

Plus I want as future President of Romania to invite all Muslim politicians to live chat with me such as Emir of Kuwait and King of Saudi Arabia, and the topic will be on reforming the behavior of Muslims so violence and terrorism will never happen again(in political point of view) 

Shariah 1 Law 1 Capital Punishments

1. Anyone who commits an act of terrorism, will be sentenced to death penalty according to Quran 5:33
2. Anyone who commits pedophilia will be lashed one hundred times, because pedophilia is not acceptable for it violates Quran 4:6
3. Anyone who commits ""honor"" killing will be sentenced to death, for only a Muslim judge(qadi) has right to do sentence someone from family to death and not the father.
4. Muslim has right to leave Islam so as long as he does not commit an act of terror.
5. Necrophiles and zoophiles are to be sentenced to death, because it is great immorality which is not acceptable by any sane country
6. Anyone who commits murder regardless of his faith, will be sentenced to death for violating Quran 5:32 because life of human in general is sacred in Islam, and it should be respected at all cost.

My questions are:

1. Can a Romanian Sunnah Muslim become the future President of Romania? Or only a Christian is allowed?
2. Are my intentions acceptable for me to be the future President of Romania?
3. Can a President invite a King or Queen of a country to live chat with him?
4. Is there any chance of becoming the future President of Romania since I have pure heart and since I have those intentions?

P.S. Please don't judge me quickly by calling me a troll or something like this, because this is not my intention. Besides, the capital punishments will be applied in Muslim World and not in Romania.

There are large portions of the country with contrasting ideologies. This seems rather obvious when presidential elections really come down to ""swing states"". These swing states seem to non-coincidentally be located between very red and very blue areas. Im not here to argue the validity of the electoral college though.

So a president is elected and usually by a small margin. This isn't an issue on its own, but I think it is an issue when it's between two VERY contrasted candidates. You now have half of the country very disappointed. I think a presidental election should look more like how the parties each choose a candidate. So then your guy isn't picked, but it's only a 20% difference and not a complete 180. But you could still have a smaller country with polarized views amongst citizens, so maybe that is moot.

Now think of this large country in the global political game. Does a country like the US have just too much pull because it's a such a super power? The same I think goes for Russia. And those two have rather opposing views.

Would the world be better served where massive countries were split up and a population maximum was limited for a country. Something like how monopolies are split. If a massive country starts harming human rights, besides protest within the country, how does the world handle that issue? Is the UN even strong enough to relate these superpowers?

It just seems that a county like the US would be better served split up, even for its own sake. The west coast, New England with NY, the swing states maybe on their own. Then that huge red swath in the middle of the country.

I tried to find answers by myself on Google about this, and I could not find it, because it is very important for me to know.

What really bothers me is that I don't know if the Speaker has right to establish some laws or not, since Parliament occupies with laws, then the Speaker must have full power to establish any law he wants in his country. 

Right now I'm striving hard to get the diploma of A-Level exam from my high school so I can become a Sheikh later on, so I can work as politician. Because, all what I want is to find ways of how I can exterminate ISIS and make it be the last of it's kind.

1. Can a Speaker of Kuwaiti Parliament send military troops?

- One of them, probably Rubio, resigns and DeSantis appoints Trump to be a Florida senator. This could all happen in concert with the inaguration so Trump is never not an elected official

- Trump becomes a Florida senator. Given his position in the Republican party, his fellow Republican senators vote him Majority leader (I'm assuming Democrats will lose 1 of the 2 GA special elections)

- Now Trump can nominate Senators to commitees, or Trump himself can launch investigations of his opponents in his capacity as Intelligence/Judiciary senate commitee leader

- Although he won't have executive privilege he gets the benefit of government funded lawyers to defend himself, some privilege against prosecution for things he says and does on the Senate floor and perhaps most importantly, stays in the spotlight, continues to make news every day and can completely control Joe Biden's legislative agenda

It's basically an ELI5 :).

I have never, ever in my life been interested in politics. I don't just mean the political process or candidates or issues, I mean the very pursuit or activity of it. If you were to offer me any political position in the land I would beg you to take it back. To me it generally all just feels like the most boring parts of Sim City :).

With that said, I have tried and tried and tried to understand the allure of political power for people and, except in one case, it makes no sense to me.

Here goes:

I think of it all in terms of human desire. Desires based on food, sex, sleep, money, fame, etc. etc. etc. are all real to me and seem to be intelligible rewards. But with political power, what exactly is the payoff? What is that magical carrot that makes people insane monsters and do almost anything to achieve and hold onto it?

A) Money. I kind of sort of get this. Person gets some appointment, they then can, through legitimate or usually less legitimate means, leverage the position for personal financial gain (courting lobbyists, making shady deals, getting board positions, etc.) Why this doesn't make sense to me: if I wanted to make lots of money, I'd go into finance. Politicians, when you hear about their personal assets, rarely compete with successful business/finance people. Sure, I mean I guess it's one way to make money, but it seems a very low return on investment if you look at your life and the time you could be spending toward that objective. It's just not that efficient.

B) Altruism. This is the only one case that makes sense to me. If one is a do gooder, one wants to do good. They want to help people. Sure. But... why this doesn't make sense to me reason 1: a slew of behavior by most politicians and political movements throughout history show me that these are not Good People (tm). They lie and cheat and steal and philander (and worse). The Kennedys are just one salient example. I've known many altruistic people, the sort who want to dedicate themselves to serving their fellow human beings, and they explicitly do \*not\* act like politicians, in so many ways. Now, I have seen politicians who genuinely are hard core, save the people, civil rights types, and they usually don't exhibit the sort of sociopathic, do-anything-it-takes traits of the rest, but they seem to comprise a tiny percentage of the pool. The vast majority, almost all of whom ""want to serve"", show me no signs in affirmation of this. Quite the opposite, in fact. Why this doesn't make sense to me reason 2: in many cases where you see politicians scheming and plotting and lying and machinating to gain a position, even in local government, it's something so dull and drab and feckless (""2nd Deputy Minister of Tabulated Accounts Receivables"") that there is no way they're waking up in the morning and going, ""that's it, this is how I'm going to make a difference... oh and now let me sell my own mother to get it!"" Obviously these positions have ""that carrot"" that I don't see. These are not save the world positions they get all cutthroat about.

C) Control. This is a bit like the second explanation for why I don't get altruism. A common statement/belief is that power is intoxicating. People want power over things and other people. Sure, I can see this as a desire. But again, the things they're fighting over make no sense to me in most cases. Presidency? Sure. Mayor of a town? I guess. But so many people throughout history, in fiction, etc. get political appointments as rewards or fight tooth and nail for these jobs that, to me, sound more like a homework nightmare than anything resembling real power. A perfect example of this is Ben Carson- he gets on Trump's good side, gets awarded the role of Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. What on Earth does he care about this? He's a doctor and former presidential hopeful. Now he has to deal with things like piping regulations and zoning and, like I said above, all the dull parts of Sim City :). Where is the carrot? It's not like he's going to parlay this into something grander, most likely. And again, you see this \*all\* throughout history. Nepotistic and reward-based appointments are the stuff of every corrupt tale. Union positions in old movies, all that stuff. Who on Earth cares??

Hopefully you can see what I don't understand here/what I'm missing. I in my life want things- I want to create and learn things, I want to eat tasty foods, I want to have sex, I want to wear nice clothes, I want to be physically attractive, I want to have adventures, I want to help people, I want to own things I enjoy, I want to spend time with people I like and I want people to like me. But this whole field known as politics, which is, in my opinion, possibly the single most corrupting and mania-inducing of all human pursuits, doesn't seem to fit with any of these. Sure it has elements of them all, but there has to be some X factor I'm missing because the path to the aforementioned goals is so much clearer and more straightforward/rewarding via other means. Entertainment, business, etc. all seem more direct.

And, you see this at \*every\* level of government. We all know the (very real) trope of little leagues and PTAs and home owner's associations devolving into House of Cards.

There is clearly something at stake I don't get. It all just seems like a morally suicidal path toward lots of homework/Sim City administration to me. People can't really be that into laying water pipes and power lines, can they???

My whole family especially grandparents are really into US politics, they are all republican supporters. The amount of comments I'm hearing everyday about how Biden and the democrats are for socialism and communism is crazy. I don't know much about american politics so I don't want to get involved in their discussions. One common thing I'm hearing out of my grandparents is that only liberals/democrats have intentions to hurt the economy by doing lock downs. While trump would never do such a thing/ republican states in america are doing the right thing by not locking down while states like LA are locking down "" for no reason"". So apparently my grandparents have the thinking that lockdowns= communist leaders (especially democrats) who want to hurt the economy. 

Now just earlier in Toronto, Doug Ford just made an announcement that Toronto is going into lockdown starting Monday. My grandmother who rarely is into Canadian politics said out of no where ""this was probably Justin Trudeaus idea, only liberals would do such thing to lock down the economy"". Then I said how Doug Ford is a conservatives leader who makes decisions for Ontario which is the region i'm living in. I had to emphasize and made sure that she doesn't think american democrats translates to decisions in Ontario Canada. After I said that she responded with how there are plenty of conservative's leaders who are communinst supporters.

Also it’s another common comment made in my house specifically for Canada that only the “younger generation” would support the liberals (currently Trudeau) in Canada because the younger generation hasn’t grew up to see what communism was.

- issues of hacking digital voting ballots, 
- RCV simply being to complicated for voters to choose more than one candidate, 
- It's unconstitutional 
- increasing partisanship. 
- The votes will take longer to count 
- states should decide how they vote 
- RCV will actually decrease voter turnout 
- RCV cannot function with the electoral college 

All of these arguments seem incredibly inacurate and have provided almost no or incredibly vague evidence. I have disproved them with evidence, yet somehow these views appear to be adopted by the majority in my committee. 

I am considering possible amendments to my bill that will: 
- Eliminate Winner takes all system of the electoral college
- Make voting day a national holiday 
- Counting votes for up to two weeks after an election day.

My question though; how exactly can you pardon someone for a crime they haven't even been convicted of yet? 

From a legal perspective, if Trump pardoned himself now, we'd have to ask 'what is he pardoning himself for?' He's not legally guilty of anything yet until it is proven in a court. 

Following the logic of it being possible to pre-emptively pardon, absent a conviction (which I don't agree with). If a president can pre-emptively pardon themselves of any conviction, could Trump theoretically start and engage in any illegal business he wants once he is no longer president so long as he pardons himself for specific named offences?

My original text for context

Yes they are all a problem it doesn't matter to what degree or scenario. To judge people based on the color of skin is insane. Im not assuming very much at all its just how humans work. If you don't like something but have to deal with it that scenario is doomed to fail from the start. The person will be under constant watch and scrutiny whether it be on purpose or not becuase of the already pre conceiving idea that you already don't like that person I don't care how someone thinks that they can separate that it will always bleed through and show it ugly face. Either way there both just as bad and not sure where you going with the thief as thieves in general do not discriminate as they are opportunist. stealing based on race in not good practice in their case. They are looking for the easiest target for the most money. So in that case it would have to be a 1 off or its completely invalid as that would be a terrible theif. Unless its something like theft at a corporate level where they target a certain minority rather just peer to peer robbery

His text:

“Yes they are all a problem”

That they are all a problem was obviously implied in both questions. There was no implication to the contrary. It could not be asked if they were “equally problematic” if there were not primarily problematic.

Edit: I understand this no need to elaborate

“it doesn't matter to what degree or scenario.”

One must ignore all of history or for that matter much of the contemporary world outside of the US to lay such a claim. That the degree would not matter at all is a conclusion that lacks a cogent understanding of material reality.

“To judge people based on the color of skin is insane.”

Agreed, as was implied by declaring it “problematic.” And yet, to varying degrees, some do (most around the world). If our position is superior to their position we should be able to change their hearts. That’s why I’m a Daryl Davis fan.

“Im not assuming very much at all it’s just how humans work.”

History proves that you are assuming much more about humanity than you actually understand.

“If you don't like something but have to deal with it that scenario is doomed to fail from the start.”

First, not “something” nor “it” but rather some person/persons and them. The distinction is relevant as dealing with a person or persons is characteristically unique. Second, I partially agree. Although “have to” is not synonymous with –it is somewhat equivalent to– “forced to.” Therefore, the closer a situation seems to be forced the more it is “doomed to fail.” Otherwise, unpreferable but voluntary reciprocal relationships have been the fundamental cornerstone of inter-group bonding since the beginning of history. It is just how humans work.

“The person will be under constant watch and scrutiny whether it be on purpose or not becuase of the already pre conceiving idea that you already don't like that person I don't care how someone thinks that they can separate that it will always bleed through and show it ugly face. Either way there both just as bad”

You are missing so much in this paragraph. It’s not even that you are completely wrong. It is more a conflation of a visceral hate with a preference for ones own “kind.” To define one’s “kind” by any superficial phenotypical characteristics is primitively archaic and horrible. But Black, White, and many others do just that. However, much like any other feeling that any person may have about anything at all, the degree makes a significant tangible difference with respect to willingness to “concede” or “defend” any social ground or even to explicitly aggress. History continuously bares this out.

“not sure where you going with the thief as thieves in general do not discriminate as they are opportunist. stealing based on race in not good practice in there case. They are looking for the easiest target for the most money. So in that case it would have to be a 1 off or its completely invalid as that would be a terrible theif. Unless its something like theft at a corporate level where they target a certain minority rather just peer to peer robbery”


“peer to peer robbery” - I will have to assume a meaning 

Where I’m eventually going is my next question. But first, I will address to your last paragraph. You have definitely lived a privileged life. I hope you are thankful for the blessing of the environment that you were fortunate to have been raised. Your blessed experience together with your youth betray your ability to logically reason without making many assumptions. You are simply wrong in your conclusion of “1 off.” I could elaborate if you’d like. But more importantly, the main reason for the example is theft of real property targeted racially. Which is a horrendously despicable offense that demands remedy. But I shall not digress.

Lastly, is the person(s) that would neither befriend nor employ someone regardless of them being the ""best person for the job"" or would even target a person for significant theft specifically because of their race equally as problematic as any persons who would impose significant permanent bodily injury up to and including killing someone because of their race?",True,False,False,Askpolitics,t5_2s5s2,1881,public,,self,Can anyone help me disect this wall of political jargon sent to me as an argument.

I'm conservative economically and in terms of general government regulation - I want less taxes and more freedom. However I'm not radical, I believe in a social safety net (the govt should provide food and shelter to those who do not have it) and a public option for healthcare. 

I'm also pretty conservative on some other issues, such as race issues (I don't support the organization/movement BLM), and generally on PC stuff and cancel culture.

I'm a moderate on immigration - I think we should have a lot of legal immigration, but not decriminalize the border.

I'm democratic on gun control - while I support the second amendment I think we need a firearms registry, background checks, and an assault weapons ban/buyback. I'm also democratic on abortion (pro-choice), gay marriage (pro gay marriage), and criminal justice (I want to decriminalize drugs, and lower our prison population).

&amp;#x200B;

My views might seem to line up with libertarians, but the party is far too radical for me. I disagree with them on foreign policy (I believe the US should intervene and have troops abroad), their economic policy is a bit too radical for me (as is their immigration policy) and there's a bunch of stuff I disagree with generally, like eliminating the FDA.

From what I've read about authoritarians, then can be pretty militant when activated by a political cause.  The guy who wrote the book on these types, Prof. Bob Altemeyer, compared them to an army of ants on the march.

I think the behavior of conservatives in the Trump makes sense if you think of them as a people at war.  The conservative half of America has declared war on the liberal half.  It's not a literal shooting war but it's the same mentality.  That's why they're so uncompromising and willing to play dirty.  In war, fairness and co-operation go out the window.

As of this writing, I've read that the election result will be very close, and this shocks people even if Biden is in the lead.  Liberals hoped for a broad rejection of Trump by the American public in the form of a landslide result, but this is not happening.  It makes sense if you think of conservatives at war with liberals.   Imagine your country is at war with a foreign country.  The enemy tells you that your king is an idiot, and that life for you would be so much better if you defect to their king and adopt their foreign values and way of life.  You probably wouldn't defect even if you are dissatisfied with your king.  You remain loyal.  Imagine you're a Gallic tribesman and a Roman legion comes to town and demands that you surrender and embrace Roman rule.  They tell you your chieftain is terrible and the Roman emperor is wonderful, and they explain all the benefits of Roman culture and the Pax Romana.  You'd probably tell the Romans to piss off.  Whatever problems your people have, you're not going to surrender to the enemy tribe, adopt a foreign way of life, and live as second-class citizens.  That's how conservatives think of their struggle against liberals.

This piqued my curiosity as I wasn't completely aware of the law surrounding it and thought maybe it was allowed. I looked it up and found my state does require registration the day before early voting begins, which was just over a month ago. So my question is how is registering same day possible regardless of the law (the actual process) and will their vote still count?

Can someone who believes in the QAnon conspiracies please explain to me how people believe the elite 1% of people are evil and controlled by the cabal, but somehow separate Trump in their head (who is also part of the 1%) as not a part of that, when he is literally part of the same 1% group of evil billionaires they always complain about?

My concern is that if this conspiracy IS true, it’s WILDLY dangerous to fool yourself that Trump wouldn’t be involved, as someone who has been a part of the 1% his and his family’s entire life pretty much. Yet a lot of people think he is the one good billionaire here to save the day literally as Jesus in some people’s beliefs.
