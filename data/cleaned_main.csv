Let me explain The name of your movement should be Clear and not easy to manipulate The core message would be to make charging mothers to hold their babies immediately after birth should be illegal Now I m no fool I understand the charge is so hospital s can get a bigger check from the insurance companies This would still be a huge win for both parties and a small part of the Healthcare system would change If we look forward into future this is also a part of normalizing progress for women Maybe I m a dummy Maybe the title should be different Let me know,A push labeled Let mothers hold their babies,0

Some international observers have argued that Ukraine should remain neutral not only from NATO but also the EU while I can understand the logic that Ukrainian membership into NATO may raise Russian security concerns I don t understand how closer EU Ukraine relations can threaten Russian security interests considering that it would be mostly economic My question is why does Russia oppose the expansion of the European Union Does the EU present any significant threat to Russian interests,What threat does EU expansion pose towards Russia,0

That Russia tried to seize the capital and install a puppet but it failed And the new strategy now is to force Ukraine to give up by just bombing every thing mostly civilians to get them to give up Is it true that they seize the capital and tried to install a puppet but got kicked out Or is the Ukraine military just very good and may be two or three weeks before they get to the capital It appears the Russian military is having a hard time fighting the military in Ukraine that the military in Ukraine is just as good or better than the Russian military And if that case than Russia may lose the war or take months to control Ukraine if the military in Ukraine is just as good or better than the Russian military,Can some one here explain if this is true about the Russia and Ukraine thing,0
i often see controversies about wether certain states should apologise to others for atrocities they committed in the past and i dont see whats the big deal isnt an apology just empty words anyway just something a politician chooses to say when its in his best interest if for example the USA decided to apologise to Japan for the nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki what would that change for the Japanese people,What does it mean when states apologies,0
Russia and Belarus already invaded and attacked Ukraine they might go for Moldova next Doesn t it make sense for Sweden and Finland to join Nordic Europe could be easily reached by Russia Planes from Kaliningrad can drop bombs on Stockholm Sweden within hours same with St Petersburg dropping bombs on Helsinki Finland within hours Nordic Europe needs a safety guarantee You can t keep waiting for Moldova to get swallowed up next Time is running out,Why are Sweden and Finland wasting time with NATO,0
When Turkey does not behave at all as a member of the North Atlantic Alliance Should other member states of the North Atlantic Alliance come to its aid in the event of an attack And shouldn t Turkey be fired by the North Atlantic Alliance if it doesn t behave like a member at all,Do you feel that Turkey is currently only a formal member of the North Atlantic Alliance and there is no real way to count on its support for other members of the alliance,0
A lot of leaders not all of course make decisions that will benefit their countries in the long strategic terms To give credit where it is due Putin enhanced Russia s international image either good or bad in the last decades since the fall of the USSR Some of his past decisions is undoubtedly to stoke Russian nationalism in order to boost his own popularity ratings but nonetheless these gave Russia some semblance of international respect But I don t see how invading Ukraine would benefit Russia in the long term even if his initial plan to seize the country in two weeks worked out If his blitz plan worked Russia and Putin still would have faced severe sanctions as what already happened to them So what exactly is Putin s goal,Does Putin think he s doing Russia a favour by invading Ukraine,0

Russia having the third biggest military in the world is losing the war Every day tanks are getting stuck in the mud breaking down and running out of gas There been cases Russia had to pull the military back to get fuel truck and supplies than go back in And in war you don t want to waste time even three hours make big difference Well Russia is wasting time money energy military assets and resources bombing many hospitals and many apartments and civilian Well the Ukraine military organize and build up and counter Russia Well Russia spends endless weeks of wasting time money energy military assets and resources bombing many non military and government buildings Why This makes no sense You would think a third biggest military in the world would destroy of the Ukraine military and government in two or three weeks And be at the capital by now not bombing mon government and military sites What is Russia drunk or what How can Russia military and Russia government be so disorganized and terrible at war You would think Russia would stop bombing civilians and go to the capital and destroy of the Ukraine military and government than wasting time money energy military assets and resources Well the Ukraine military organize and build up and plan and counter,What has happen to the Russian military,0

I recently read Mich McConnell said in a speech to the Senate he wanted Biden to assist the Polish in sending aircraft to Ukraine If the US going to war requires a majority vote why should such a question be offered as a vote I don t want to hear about the political speech by one side etc I m just curious why a question like that which would lead to war not be a valid vote for the House and Senate,Why are US potential actions not voted in the house amp senate,0

Sorry if this question isn t appropriate here I m writing a fantasy book and have been calling the fallen government an empire because it s fantasy and I think kingdom is overdone I don t think empire is the correct term though Using irl peoples history for simplicity Basically it s like if the Native Hawaiians invaded America while the Native Americans were at war with the Europeans then became the rulers The NAs confederacy had been pushed to the West Coast The NHs joined them and together forced the Europeans back to the Northeast They agree to end the war with the NHs as the absolute rulers and the NAs getting their land back Would this be the Kamehameha Kingdom Kamehameha Empire Kamehameha Something else Thank you,What would this type of government be called,0
Due to conflict between Russia Ukraine we saw how the Internet and social media are almost as important as the frontline of war The problem is that there is no neutral media I see that both West and Russian media are full of propaganda I have relatives in Kiev Donetzk and Russia So each time I read something important big I am trying to confirm it with them But most of the population does not have this luxury What can one do to separate the news from propaganda How do you understand which news is true and which is propaganda basically cherry picked info or flat out lie,How to pick true news in Information war,0

My father says that we re in a post America phase meaning that the USA isn t as a global power and can t maintain peace I don t know what to think of this because the world was pretty fucked up even before the s My father also says it s Biden s fault and that all it took was one year but I d be inclined to argue that it would take more than a year for a country to fall like that and that if the USA did stop being the global power then that would be symptomatic of more going wrong than one year of one term in a Presidency,Are we in a post America phase If so would you consider it Biden s fault,0
This question is addressed to Western world representatives Western politics as Boris Johnson for example said that he didn t believe that situation on Ukraine went from Russian people but most part of sanctions are against people not only against common Russian but against those Russian who were loyal to West I mean canceling TOEFL exams canceling MBA diploma I believe most of these people sharing Western lifestyle and values and planned to build carrier with western companies or even moved there I suppose tht huge part of these people didn t support government in Ukrainian question So what the purpose of sanctions against them Maybe I missed something,What s the purpose of sanctions agains common Russian people,0
Would Putine have invaded Ukraine now if he was kept more in checked after elections,Did Trump Preaidency embolden Putine,0
At this point we ve seen this ineffectiveness of the Russian army We are already seeing the effects on the sanctions as well If they surrender AND their economy is in shambles their oil is no longer being bought and the internal conflicts are happening at once which they are that will surely knock them down a few notches Is the only reason they re a superpower because of the massive amounts of nuclear weapons they have,If Russia surrenders and these sanctions stay would they still be a superpower,0
Both Finland and Sweden are EU countries and they are both exposed meaning they are on the outside edge of NATO s red line Finland is doing the smart thing and opening parliamentary debates on NATO while the Swedish PM is straight up not allowing any opposition discussion on it That s ridiculous dangerous and stupid Russia has clearly showed that it will swallow up nations not inside NATO if it can Why is Sweden being stupid,Why is Sweden being stubborn over NATO,0

Francis Fukuyama s The End of History and the Last Man book in claimes that after the fall of the USSR that it is inevitable that Liberal Democracy will eventually be everywhere and allong with the Democratic Peace Theory will end history of major events like war I think this has been proven wrong with events like the rise of an aggresive China and the War on Terror the events in Ukraine now and the Arab Spring Was the idea just a delusion made by the Unipolar Moment or was it accurate,Does anyone here still believe that we are living in or is possible to reach the end of history and if so why,0

Let s just say the USA or the UK directly attacks Russia for invading Ukraine why would Russia then nuke the USA or the UK when that ll just result in themselves being nuked back Wouldn t they just rather fight NATO with conventional weapons even if the odds are against them in terms of winning Your country may get occupied and bombed with conventional weapons but it won t be nuked which is the worst possible outcome for your country,Why would any country threaten to use nuclear weapons if it will just result in the same thing happening to them,0

I m in the USA just to set up the context for my following post It s in regard to American oil reserves and independence So I had a friend state that since Biden was in office we ve lost oil independence I ll admit that I don t have any idea where we are in that regard but I wanted to know more so I did as best as I can to look it up I found this website ashx n pet amp s mttntus amp f m which shows our net imports of oil and it seems to me that we re still oil independent I understand that we re not producing of our own oil but that the term Oil Independence is generally accepted to be just a net exporter of oil which makes sense to me This got me thinking how much oil do we have in the ground Like if we keep pumping oil out of the ground at the same rate as we are today when is oil going to run out In this site php id amp t I see that our consumption is about billion barrels a year and this article html text That s according to a new billion barrels of oil reserves claims we have about billion barrels underground in the USA still That leads to about years of oil left at the given rate barring technology advances that make more oil recoverable which I know is inevitable This number seems roughly in line with other articles I found stating around years of oil supply left give or take Anyways assuming I m reasonably understanding the previous statements I m wondering why energy independence is such a big goal for the United States I understand wanting the ability to be entirely independent but why would we use American oil when we could be using oil from other countries that are more than happy to sell it to us Certainly not importing of our oil but if we could import enough to stretch our year supply our to or Then and years down the road when the supply starts to dry up abroad the USA still has plenty of oil underground and is in a much better situation then In the meanwhile work on green renewable energy sources in the hopes that years from now all that underground oil will end up lasting longer and longer as time goes on Anyways sorry for the naivety of my post but I don t particularly follow this aspect of politics and I haven t seen anyone bring up the talking point of where our country will be a half century down the line in regards to oil I appreciate all input on the subject or pointing me towards reading on the subject,Question about oil reserves and oil independence,0

Most all public colleges in the U S are primarily funded and wholly governed by the State but most efforts to achieve free four year public education focus on the federal government I am wondering how these proposals affect how public colleges will be governed since the Federal Government would play a much larger role in funding these schools Would the Fed take over these public colleges I am assuming not What would the remaining role of states be in funding public higher ed Would state governments have less of a say in running these schools Would schools that refuse to accept certain federal guidelines lose public funds I m not looking for a debate about the merits of free public four year college but information about how it would actually be implemented,How would free public college change the way public colleges are governed,0

If the US bans imports of Russian oil as it indicates it will What would stop arbratage of Russian Oil to sell it to US companies despite the sanctions And at what price point does this become profitable enough that the Russian economy could return to presanctioned levels,is a ban on Russian Oil actually feasible,0
Thread gets autobanned in AskUK so I ask in UKpolitics to see it s autobanned so I m asking here Lots of british politicians weren t happy they still work Question is how banning them will help exactly They think it s designed to reduce Putin s support rate But that will raise siege mentality here even further Some of sanctions hit me personally I kinda can t vote with my feet at this point as plane ticket prices skyrocketed because most of planes were leased I m against everything happening but what can I realistically do Challenge military censhorship to get in prison Protest to get in jail lose job Vote to see that elections are rigged for years once again,UK politicians want fast food to stop working in Russia How would banning fast food chains in Russia help,0
UK sanctions against Russian banks including assets freezes come with a day wind down period in which at least some kinds of transactions are allowed to take place See various news stories such as this It s been widely shared on Twitter as evidence of blatant corruption and collusion with oligarchs So is the UK really giving Russian banks a whole month to sell their assets before they are frozen or is there more nuance here,Is the day sanctions loophole as egregious as it looks,0
I think Chechnya is an obvious break away state as would Tatarstan Do you folks see Siberia or all of Western Russia breaking away How about Novgorod being its own republic Maybe some lands returning to Japan islands or Finland Land grab by China I certainly see a large land mass around Moscow remaining as the original Russia Curious where the other pieces end up going,What could Russia look like if they went through another dissolution breakup,0
As far as I know all existing socialist states were built on Marxism Leninism which actually means an authoritarian form of socialism where the majority does not rule but the avant garde of professional revolutionaries and some states had an ideology based on Marxism Leninism such as Maoism or Juche And there were socialist experiments as anarchist during the Spanish Civil War and the Russian Civil War or the Paris Commune but none of these attempts survived the end of the war during which it arose And do you think there can ever be a socialist state that is democratic and human rights and freedoms are respected,Was there ever a state in the world that was socialist and at the same time it was a democratic state where human rights were respected,0
I found this take I hadn t seen before on Putin s motivations for invading Ukraine here I don t consider myself an expert on this at all but I ve been struggling to understand what Putin could possibly be looking to achieve at this point in the war Putin is many things but he s not stupid and a large number of people believe that he simply miscalculated for Ukraine which I dearly hope to be true Could Putin really achieve another Cold War by dragging America into firing the first shot What s everyone s thoughts on this,Does Putin really want another cold war,0
I know it s probably impossible improbable but all the same,Would it be acceptable for Ukraine to push into Russia if they could or would it no longer be self defense at that point,0
It seems the reason NATO countries aren t helping Ukraine directly is because of the threat of nuclear war If Russia invaded a NATO country for example one of the Baltic states Poland or Romania then I still can t see France the UK or the USA directly attacking Russia even then because the threat of nuclear war will still be the same regardless of the NATO alliance,Couldn t Russia get away with invading any NATO country that doesn t have nukes,0
This might be a more hypothetical question than a real one because I m not sure UAV s exist that can engage in air to air combat but if we pretend they do exist what would be the legalities NATO deploying UAV hardware and pilots If those were used to enforce a no fly zone the enemy would have no idea where the actual pilots were flying from or what nationality those pilots are so NATO could simply deny any accusation they were involved Is it lying Yes it is but no more lying than Russia has been doing all along,Why can t NATO or whoever else grant Ukraine s request to enforce a no fly zone using drones,0
The longer they drag it out for the more likely there is to be world war We know Russia will defeat Ukraine in the end anyway,Why doesn t Ukraine just surrender instead of dragging it out,0
It seemed like the Cold War ended in But then it restarted I m not just talking about current events in Ukraine US and Russia supporting different sides in Syria seems a lot like the Cold War Crimea and Donbas also seemed like that in Maybe even Georgia in is related because Georgia decided to become a NATO member When the Baltic States and other Eastern European countries joined NATO in that seems to have still been okay It seems that after the breakup of the Soviet Union Russia intended to keep some former Soviet republics in their sphere of influence and as the West started trying to integrate those countries Russia found that unacceptable,When and why did the Cold War start again,0
I m sure it happens all over the world but I m wanting to know from the American point of view do the lobbyists point blank say to our politicians support this piece of legislation and we ll donate to your campaign Is that simply how it works Is that completely legal What other perks do the politicians receive if any We talk about politicians being bought by corporations but why can t the politicians just support something that goes against their donors interests Are they under contract Will they be threatened I hope this makes sense I ve just come to look at politics through House of Cards colored glasses and would love to know the truth,How do the conversations between corporate lobbyists and politicians typically go USA,0

My gut reaction to the recent invasion in Ukraine is that the western powers should do more than just sanctions and provide weapons however I understand that things could escalate quicker if a NATO troop fires on a Russian troop What I m confused about is why Putin doesn t see sanctions and weapons as the same as boots on the ground both have the same intended aim of stopping his invasion I d like to understand what the distinction is here and if it is just an agreed upon rule of war or if it is just a misunderstanding on my part Thanks,What s the difference between funding a resistance weapons aid and sending troops,0
Seriously why do Russians keep supporting this man His war with Ukraine is unnecessary and pointless that is killing both Ukrainian civilians and Russian soldiers As a result the West made several sanctions against Russia hurting their economy and making the Ruble worthless now Russian Business cant trade and do business with the west and the Central bank is cut off from the major banks in the world So i ask again why is Putin still having high approval ratings,Why are Putin s approval ratings still very high amid thr conflict in Ukraine,0
US does the science China does the work Japan does the art Third world countries send the best of their kind to help other countries be better Russia is a nuclear counterweight necessary And what about EU It can t compare to any of the countries above in what they are doing Why is it considered a good place to be I read about the economics of EU s leading countries but it still looks like a big money laundering So why is it still considered a good place to live for an average person,What is EU good for,0
Russia gets boxed in by NATO Putin keeps threatening to do something if NATO comes to his doorstep and then walks into Ukraine I get that s wrong But now Russia is being literally cancelled No financial cultural political or any other transactions allowed And at the same time we have US allies killing and starving people in their hundreds of thousands Saudi Arabia in Yemen Israel s criminal actions in Gaza and of course the smoking ruins of Iraq Syria and Libya which did not even so much as raise a finger in anger to the US I don t get it Can anyone explain what s going on,Why is Russia getting cancelled when the US has literally wiped three different countries that represented no threat whatsoever to it off the map and this just in the last years and had nothing at all happen to them I m genuinely curious,0
America became best friends forever with Europe including Germany and Italy that they defeated in the war along with Japan that they also defeated in the war After WWI it seem that embracing the losers of a war became America s ideology What makes impossible for Russia to be an ally to the United States Right now of course that would be useless But during Yeltsin and early Putin era There are way more points of agreement than disagreement in my view,Why Russia is opposed to the West,0
The world sort of did not get too rattled by the Annexation of Ukraine That prosecutor went along with it There was no uprising Objectively he could make the argument to take the Russian supporting areas but Kyiv of the world is against him,What is the rationale for Russia invading Ukraine in it s entirety and taking the city of Kyiv Why did Putin not simply annex the disputed pro Russian areas in eastern Ukraine and leave it at the as he did with Crimea,0
Consumer companies like Apple or BMW pulling out of a relatively meagre consumer market like Russia for PR purposes makes sense to me Uber capitalist amoral energy mercenaries like Exxon not so much Am I being paranoid or does anyone else suspect that this move means they know something we don t about the chances of major escalation,Exxon is pulling out of Russia is this a bellwether for a larger war,0
He thinks that the big left wing media outlets cheerlead for the left s agenda just as Fox News does for the right Personally I think they are all toxic and wish he would get more news from NPR and print journalism But Fox News clearly has a pattern of misinformation that is intended to anger their audience members and keep them addicted to outrage What examples can I point out to prove this tendency,My dad is an enlightened centrist who believes that MSNBC CNN are mirror images of Fox News How can I convince him this is a false equivalence,0
seems like it could happen either way he wins and continues expanding into NATO countries triggering WW or he loses decides to take everyone with him Additional question how long until either the apocalypse occurs or we can say for sure that the threat has decreased to what it was before this all went down,Is nuclear escalation more likely if Putin wins in Ukraine or if he loses,0
Why was Trump and also Biden spending billions of dollars every month just pumping up the stock market Well the stock market would crash and the US would be in a major recession if the government was not pumping up the stock market But the US government spending billions of dollars every month buying stocks and bonds And the US government investing money in oil companies shipping travel cruise ship airline companies hotel stock so on well the lockdown was going on And Trump and Biden doing nothing to help small middle businesses and upper middle businesses and only helping very large businesses Is this really helping the economy How can this really help the economy When the price of every thing is going up now and there is shortage of goods Or was this just Trump and Biden helping his business friends get more money,The US government spent billions of dollars every month just pumping up the markets is this really helping the economy,0
Both of those are attempts to forcibly retain control of people in a region without their consent Most people I ve come across condemn the latter as do I yet think the former is completely justified I am trying to figure out the distinction,If a state tried to secede from the US would the federal government use military force in order to prevent them If so wouldn t that be just as bad as Russia s invasion of Ukraine,0
You ll often see right wing Westerners being strongly against immigration from countries that don t hold Western values But a lot of those same anti immigration people share more values with the immigrants they fear than with left wing Westerners Their stances on abortion LGBTQ drugs porn art gender roles and feminism are not all that different,Why do conservative white people dislike conservative brown people,0

In light of recent events I came to find out just how much oil the U S buys from Russia and other places as well I am sure How does shutting down pipelines help the environment if the same amount of oil is still being purchased elsewhere Not to mention the oil is now having to be shipped from further away meaning that more fuel is being burned to get the oil to its final destination Is shutting down U S oil production simply virtue signaling Is the long term plan actually to use up others oil first to turn a greater profit on our own and environmental friendliness simply being used as a scapegoat for lack of a better word Or am I missing something,How does shutting down oil pipelines help the environment,0
America barely gets sanctioned and they ve invaded numerous countries Yet when Russia does it once in a blue moon they re sanctioned so hard their economy is fucked,Why is it that when America invades a country people just accept it cause that s just what America does and when Russia does the same thing they are despised by everyone,0

I am not sure if the title is correct but I have some examples Suppose a politician is not in favour of ukrain and he s giving an interview now when journalist asks him justification he would say where were you this was happening in Palestine We know how it is in India since the rule of BJP RSS Muslims are being terrorised by these Hindutva groups Now of course there are anti social elements in both groups But when someone states an incident which BTW very common these days like Muslim man lynched by a mob or innocent Muslim man was burnt to death for suspicious of carrying beef People from right wing would go on about some other isolated incident where this one time a Muslim man might have killed a Hindu Now I know these counter argument doesn t make much sense I am not sure if they can be called counter arguments But is there a terminology used for these arguments,What is it called when an argument is counter by an unrelated argument,0

Even tho the war in Ukraine have a purpose but in other middle east country they have no valid motif or purpose to do the same thing Russia did to Ukraine it s obvious im from an Islamic country from Africa not even ME and i m talking about wars thats happens IN IRAQ PALESTINE and SYRIA and so many more I saw so many racist comments in TV about how the refuges of Ukraine are welcome because they are clean and middle class workers compared to terrorists refuges from SYRIA OR AFGHAN they said literally these words so many reporters not not when an Egyptian player ABOUTRIKA supported GAZA i said supported not even asked about baning teams to play then DIRECTLY FIFA SAID WE CANT MIX SPORT AND WAR and now they ban all Russians teams from playing like WTF IS THIS This hypocrisy makes me sick,I m really wondering why all the world all the medias all the platforms supported Ukraine but if something more severe and bad happen in an Islamic country it gets fewer reactions compared to what I m seeing right now,0
Thought arose from allegations that CPAC has historically received direct contributions from Russia How is this legitimate Even if the dems were taking money from Canada it does not seem okay Domestic politics should not receive funding from foreign interests that seems such a violation of sovereignty,On what grounds are domestic political organizations action committees justified in receiving foreign funds of any kind,0
Modern warfare and the logistics involved mean that success is founded on lots and LOTS of planning and prep Much is said about the unparalleled success of the US intelligence regarding the Ukraine crisis The US intel has correctly telegraphed all of Putins moves with apparent flawlessness as far as the media will say Obviously this war has been brewing since but how sure was US intel that Putin would launch a full scale military invasion in February of Logically three questions emerge How long did the Kremlin plan for a full Ukrainian invasion and siege of Kiev How long was the US aware of Kremlin intentions with Ukraine Was the US abandonment of Afghanistan in anticipation of potential War in Europe,Did the Biden admin retreat from the Afghan disaster in anticipation of the potential European war,0
Sorry if it sounds like a mouthful,If WW Happens what will become of Pop Culture Media many Actors Singers Directors Game Devs and Internet Content Creators will lose their lives Plus the Economy could also take a tumble I am worried that my Media would never be the same should I be concerned,0
There s this massive Russian convoy coming in from Belarus to Kyiv some reports say mi long some even mi html and despite having access to drones and successfully destroying other convoys it seems like they haven t hit these guys yet At first I thought maybe they re being accompanied by protective air forces but according to various reporters on the ground and military experts in general that doesn t seem to be the case So I m legitimately wondering why this convoy hasn t been hit Am I missing something Is there a tactical advantage to letting them get closer Would love to learn more about military tactics Thanks,Is there a tactical advantage to delay destroying a convoy,0
I tried to post in r outoftheloop but it was deleted I haven t read anything about WHY the war started,why did Russia decide to start war with Ukraine,0
Many claim that oligarchs have a lot of power in Russia Why would they permit this war when sanctions can be so harmful to them I imagine oligarchs care about freedom to enjoy their wealth safety that their wealth won t be taken away and opportunities to accumulate more wealth All this is threatened by sanctions I also imagine oligarchs aren t simply stupid or falling prey to Russian propaganda Surely becoming an oligarch requires being intelligent and well informed So if they re willing to sacrifice a lot for the sake of this war then they probably see some real threat,Why would Russian oligarchs permit invasion of Ukraine when sanctions can hurt them so much,0
When he ran against Obama I only did not vote for him because Obama was black competent and a moderate But Romney still seemed qualified then he just was up against an extremely challenging rival However Biden is no Obama I would personally relish voting for Romney over Biden Romney might actually reintroduce fiscal conservative policies to undermine the debt unlike the last spendthrift RINO,Would Romney run for office in,0
As a Brit and an American I d love either of my countries to offer some air support tbh Everyone is saying not to provoke Russia but the truth is that he s already as unhinged as he s going to get Russia don t have the resources to take on NATO by themselves and they know trying to take on NATO would be signing their own death warrant they don t have allies beyond Belarus or whatever in this fight so individual countries don t really have anything to lose by helping there s honestly not much Russia could do to retaliate He s already talking about using nukes so IMO letting the situation go unchecked leads to a higher risk of that if other countries join the fight he ll realize its unwinnable and back off it more quickly He needs to know definitively he s lost and quickly dragging it out by not intervening is only going to let him escalate gradually Which countries do you think would be likeliest to intervene IMO BoJo is a huge Churchill fan putting British boots on the ground now would a good tribute to that legacy so hopefully us but idk,How likely is it that other countries will join the military effort in Ukraine actively fighting rather than sending weapons,0
If you look at the operations of the CIA and organizations like the National Endowment of Democracy it appears that if you have enough money power and access to a population you can influence the views of that population and ultimately create whatever results you desire within their electoral system Foucault for better or for worse made a strong case that knowledge and power are inextricably linked The right dissemination of information can either maintain power or destroy it This is just patently true And while information and media CAN hold truth to power and expose horrible atrocities it can also do the exact opposite The media is often used to downplay unfortunate truths about the state a politician or a historical event This in turn affects voting habits So in a way the electoral consent of the people is manufactured by the media in which they gravitate towards Even the democratic party practically admitted that this is the case whenever they accused Russia of interfering in American politics through bots on Facebook and other social media If democracy is so fragile that random accounts spewing misinformation can greatly shift the results of an election then how much more power do big media conglomerates have when it comes to selecting candidates and promoting politcal ideologies I understand that multiple parties are constantly attempting to influence public opinion and democracy so it isn t as simple as saying that it s flat out rigged like an illuminati esque conspiracy theory would suggest But there are multiple heavy hitters like fox news and CNN that have an unparalleled amount of power in influencing elections So is democracy and the electoral process mainly decided by mass media,Is democracy rigged by mass media,0
When the UK and USA invade Iraq under some fake excuse to install a western puppet government there is some hate for it but not that much When Russia does the same thing they re internationally condemned to a whole other level,Why does it seem like the UK and USA get way less hate than Russia for doing the same thing,0
I know it s a huge and maybe even silly question to ask being as ignorant of Eastern European history as I am and I don t expect much in the way of an answer It seems like in this day and age it makes little sense for super power rivalries A legitimate good faith alliance would benefit both sides in a military and economic sense could it be achieved at all So aside from hundreds of years of animosity propaganda on both sides and bad blood what are the barriers to improving Russian relations to the point of becoming allies Is it simply a matter of the current leadership in power Is there a road map to get Russia to become an ally as far fetched and fantastical as it may seem,Could Russia ever become a Western ally,0
Putin basically said that Minsk treaty was no longer in place because Ukraine broke it and I heard something similar claimed by Ukraine who actually broke the treaty And was there any guarantees which were given to Russia in the Minsk treat or any other treaty that NATO won t accept Ukrainian membership I have heard that Putin felt cornered because he felt cornered as Ukraine didn t adhere to not wanting to join NATO and this made him invade Ukraine due to him feeling cornered Any truth to these claims,Can anyone summarize the Minsk treaty also Minsk II and why both Ukraine and Russia blame each other of violating it,0
Started thinking about this whole thing and one of my classmates was saying why doesn t Ukraine surrender and not join NATO Tbh I m kind of confused about the whole situation lol,What would happen if Ukraine was to surrender to Russia,0
Here is a YT video from RealLifeLore breaking down the WHY of Russia invading Ukraine He makes a lot of good points and explains it in a pretty neutral manner Anybody have any thoughts,Do you look at Russia s actions through a geopolitical lens or just think Putin is evil and wants WW,0
After Saddam invaded Kuwait and Bush the Elder began organizing the coalition which expelled him from that country the anti war left engaged in mass protests of the U S and its coalition partners They didn t mobilize against U S actions in the break up of Yugoslavia particularly Kosovo They were back in the streets protesting the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq It wasn t just in the U S or countries which participated either throughout Europe the antiwar left flocked to the streets to protest U S militarism and imperialism Now Putin has invaded Ukraine further breaching the promise Russia made to Ukraine in the Budapest Memorandum And there s silence about Russia s militarism and imperialism So where are they If you re someone on the antiwar left why aren t you protesting Russia today,Where s the anti war left,0
What concessions and negotiations will Ukraine have to make with Russia to end military attacks Will the territories of the former Soviet Union fall into the same situation as Ukraine in the future Is Russia s reason for war is to avoid Ukraine joining NATO and or make Soviet Union great again What is the possibility of similar conflicts between China Taiwan Vietnam Sorry if I m asking stupid question I m just a teenager with no actual knowledge about this and I want to know more And English is not my first language,What is the possibility of ending the war,0

So news just broke that Putin has attacked some of Japans merchant vessels threatened Finland and Sweden with consequences if they chose to pursue NATO membership But realistically how many countries would it take for NATO to think oh wow this guys ambitions are a threat to most of Europe let s step in overriding their risk of nuclear war,How many Non NATO countries would it like for NATO to become worried enough to actually intervene in Russia s Putins activities,0
Is NATO deserving of some of the blame it gets Like human rights violations during their operations in Afghanistan Or is this fake propaganda Is NATO good for peacekeeping on the long run or are they equally as power hungry as Russia Forgive me I don t know much about this and would like to know more,What do you think about NATO,0
Anyone here know about how different governments work Are there any nations that works like this or close to this There would be many specialist people maybe like around Each of them covers a specific topic like effective of abortion or a group of people A group of specialist would be better than specialist ofc They could decide in any of the many ways that would work that part doesn t matter much,Countries governments like this,0
My father thinks it s Biden s fault I honestly don t think America can or should step out of line with NATO also can t a President not declare war without Congress s approval So wouldn t Putin have done this anyway Any thoughts would be appreciated It doesn t really matter to me but it s starting to annoy me that my father says Democrats voted for Ukrainians to be killed as if Russia hadn t already been predatory toward Ukraine before,So if Trump was President would this with Ukraine all have happened,0
i get accusations like terrorist or commie or racist as these are recent threats to the western peoples safety but nazi that was long ago why are people still afraid of them try to destroy them they were already destroyed almost a century ago i might not have some vital info on the matter as i have lived in saudi arabia my whole life,why is being called a nazi still a ligit accusation in western countries,0
putin invades ukraine and is immediately declared a war criminal gets sanctioned out the wazoo bush invades iraq yoinks billion oil nothing happens why,why does it work like this,0
When USA invaded Iraq WW didn t happen so why would this be any different Only if a nuclear power attacks Russia do I see it being a real possibility but that would be a very irresponsible and stupid thing to do Let Russia and Ukraine settle it out together without outside interference If Russia wins and sets up a puppet government leave it at that I somehow can t see them going further and invading a NATO country but if they do then WW will be on the table but just taking over Ukraine alone shouldn t put it on the table imo,Is there any reason why the Russian invasion of Ukraine should cause WW,0
So someone said to me the following scenario and it makes sense in my non political brain I do follow politics but I m not savy or that interested generally Scenario Russia forces NATOs hand US is called to assist NATO GOP who has been stoking Putin support in the US votes to refuse to go to war We get kicked out of NATO or pulled out Russia attacks us and we stand alone or Russia as a NATO country gets support from the world against us Is this possible I m also located in Northern California near San Francisco,I m not super political and I m completely out of the loop but someone told me a scenario that scared me Reasonable people only please,0
With the state of the world is it advised to do this Maybe this is such a dumb question but I d rather feel dumb now than in the case I d need one I live in Orange County ca near an airport as well as fairly close to Disneyland I just saw a map of US Russian targets in the case this war would go nuclear and there s some pinpoints for sure where I m located Should I be prepared for the worst Or is it unlikely enough,Should I prep an emergency evacuation kit to keep in my home car,0
Trump would not have imposed sanctions on Russia or at least not harsh sanctions He was never interested in messy foreign affairs and even recently he has shown admiration for Putin I know the U S isn t the only country but surely that would have been a huge help to have one of the world leaders not supporting huge sanctions,Why didn t Putin invade during Trump s tenure,0
If such studies had really been done was anything truly effective found from it Why hasn t that yet been implemented Or is it stopped by politicians because of lack political goodwill,Politics inherently attract power hungry amp greedy people Which is why we mostly end up with politicians in power who are bad for the normal average working class poor people Has there been a branch of political science that studied on stopping this ever continuous vicious cycle,0
Assuming Putin invades and completely takes over Ukraine what exactly is the payoff He says he s worried about NATO but by invading a sovereign country doesn t he actually make NATO expansion even more likely Is there some economic advantage I ve read Ukraine has significant mineral resources but given the size of Russia I doubt there lacking any significant reserves So is this just an ego thing He wants to be the guy he re made Mother Russia,What exactly is the upside for Putin and Russia in invading Ukraine,0
Trump s views on Russia run directly counter to all the gains made by NATO during the cold war a product of decades of stedfast REPUBLICAN counter soviet efforts The American global empire stretching from S Korea to nearly Ukraine is all of a sudden under fire by Trump why Its such a democrat thing to want to dismantle American global hegemony for emotional cultural reasons I cannot fathom why republicans are now leading this charge Its somewhat offensive that the party which once championed a strong foreign posture is now recanting in the face of Russian aggression Of course NATO allies don t pay as much as Americans we own the alliance Its our nuclear umbrella most European NATO allies have little sovereignty because of US dominance Why would REPUBLICANS want to dismantle this wellspring of raw American power Aren t we supposed to be the realists,What is happening to Republican ideology How can realists support Trump on Russia,0
What is your personal opinion will naturalized citizens be able to run for president by or if they show loyalty to the United States served in the military lived for at least years in the US have only US citizenship I know that serving in the military does not necessarily mean that someone is loyal to the country but even being born in the United States does not mean that,Question for my fellow Americans,0
I understand that Ukraine is an independent country and they re allowed to decide to join NATO I also understand that NATO is free to allow anyone to join So in a simple absolute sense Ukraine should be allowed to join NATO But this reminds me of the quote from Star Wars Only a Sith deals in absolutes Not allowing any more former Soviet republics to join NATO may be a reasonable accommodation to give to Russia NATO was formed to defend against the Soviet Union and so for a long time they were Russia s primary opponent It s understandable that seeing that spreading so close to their borders can be seen as threatening It seems weird to see all the accommodations given to China over Taiwan and yet the West refuses to simply disallow a former Soviet republic from joining NATO Taiwan only recognized by a few countries not a part of the UN and not even allowed to use their name and flag at the Olympics I understand the argument that due to past events Ukraine needs to be defended against Russian aggression But this argument does not seem like a good reason for allowing them to join NATO These very things are what triggers Russian aggression Also it tears up Ukraine from the inside via upsetting a lot of the large Russian minority in Ukraine Russia s moves were actually welcomed by a lot of those people Finally even supposing Ukraine joined NATO how is that supposed to defend them against Russia Would NATO really go to war against Russia over Ukraine,Why is allowing Ukraine to join NATO so important to the West,0
It may be better to live in a democracy than an authoritarian regime but why do democratic leaders have to be so incompetent People like Joe Biden Justin Trudeau and Boris Johnson are total idiots who shouldn t be running a country Leaders like Putin and Xi Jinping are totally suited to their roles despite being authoritarian in nature,Why are democratic leaders so incompetent compared to authoritarian leaders,0
Of course there are some federal regulations to this but let s say a state like California decided it wanted to build their own nuclear power plants would it be allowed or is it forbidden by federal law Has it ever been done,Can a US state independently create their own nuclear reactors,0

I m sorry if this gets asked a lot I m just completely shitting myself Even if this sounds overdramatic I m and ultimately have no idea how this shit works Will the UK be attacked Will Putin be willing to use nuclear weapons Are our troops being sent over I d really appreciate some realistic answers backed up by evidence My heart goes out to those in the Ukraine this is a devastating and ultimately pointless situation,What will happen in the UK if we go to war with Russia,0
It s an article of faith in seemingly most sectors of the American press that Putin is an autocrat But as a constitutional republic with a legislature and the trappings of democracy what does this autocracy look like in the functioning and decision making of the Russian government state If it s an illiberal democracy where those democratic institutions are just window dressing what does that mean institutionally how are his decisions unilaterally translated into action Where in the constitution or powers of the Russian presidency does he derive so called autocratic authority Is it simply that the Duma courts or whomever are too co opted or afraid to cross him,Just how autocratic is Putin s Russia in practice,0
Is he trying to reabsorb Ukraine back into Russia But if that happens the Russians will be occupying a bitterly hostile country whose people historically despised them and the international community will condemn the country through more severe sanctions I personally don t see how Russia will benefit from invading Ukraine when the world s eye is upon them and there isn t a good justification to invade a sovereign country they recognise to be as such more than twenty years ago Realistically what will Putin achieve for invading Ukraine,What exactly is Putin s end goal should he decide to invade Ukraine,0
I don t know much about this party in particular and would like to know the main focuses of it along with where it sits on the political spectrum I m sorry if this is a dumb question to ask but I think conversating with people about this topic will give me a better understanding than just googling it and reading an article Also sorry if this is the wrong place ELI doesn t allow political questions lol,What are the main points of the libertarian party,0

I think exile is a better alternative to the death penalty We can t always get death penalty s right and we could end up killing the wrong person If we exile the person to the remote island we can separate them from the rest of society with out killing them and we can bring them back if we find out it was a mistake Do you think exile is better than the death penalty View Poll,Is exile a better alternative to the death penalty,0
I m thinking his military won t be enough for the decisive and efficient victory invading Ukraine Thus he surely has a trick or two up his sleeve I started running through possibilities The nuke one came up first but I wasn t able to rule it out with enough confidence because I don t see any deterrents strong enough Please help my anxiety but also be honest to reality,What considerably effective factors are preventing Putin from using a nuke in Ukraine,0

I heard it suggested that the World Monetary Fund is ion the business of schooling up aspiring world leaders and then supporting them into office to promote their own agenda an agenda that is not in the interests of the people they represent Could this actually happen Or is it a contemporary myth,Can the WMF control governments,0
We all know that a huge percentage of the products sold in the US are manufactured in China everything from toys electronics medical supplies even American flags They also own the bulk of US foreign debt This obviously gives China a certain amount of leverage of the US What if we implemented a phased decoupling of our two economies maybe over the course of years so that businesses had time to either increase domestic production or find new providers of cheap labor in other foreign markets How would this affect the economies of the US and China and how would this affect global affairs generally,What if the US gradually stopped conducting trade business with China,0
I understand that Canadian President Trudeau initiated the Emergency Act within last couple of days What I don t understand is how he managed to put it into force while it hadn t yet been ratified by upper and lower house Can anyone help me understand this,How did Trudeau enact an emergency act before it had gone through both houses,0
In the mayoral election Nicole Malliotakis ran as Republican Conservative and Stop de Blasio While I can understand the Conservative Party the party can nominate the same person I don t see the advantage of running basically as an independent on the same ballot The same thing happened in when Curtis Sliwa ran as both a Republican and an independent Why do candidates do this and why doesn t any other state,Why do candidates in New York elections run under different labels,0
And if so roughly when would you predict it will happen,Do you think Russia will indeed invade Ukraine and why,0
After hunting on google for a few hours I can t seem to find a comparison of US voter power i e how a Wyoming voter is equivalent to New York voters in Federal elections and how that compares to the power of voters in other countries This is two questions How does US voter power distribution compare to other countries How does average US voter power compare to other countries Thanks,How does US Voter Power compare to other countries,0
I understand the history behind the cold war but was under the impression that Russia was much more of a free market economy now and not really all that communist is this true I m wondering why US Europe and Russia are at odds any more if the prior conflict used to be about economic freedom and democracy vs communism and state control Are the US and Russia really that different anymore Aren t their people you could consider oligarchs in both nations with tremendous power,Is Russia still communist I thought it was much more free market now in which case why are US Europe and Russia still such enemies,0
I understand in a senate the party in the Whitehouse has senate control But in senate committees such as the judiciary committee is the same true Senate committee votes are broken by the VP of tied Or does it simply automatically given to the party in control and the VP does not have to be present for a tie breaking vote If anyone has an answer and an article with it I would love to read it I am confused about this and all articles about a senate I could find only detail major legislation votes ect,What happens to senate committees in a senate,0
So I hear that claim all the time but no one ever provides any evidence to back it up They ll try to defend it with evidence showing that black people are arrested for or convicted more but that s where they end I acknowledge that they absolutely are arrested and convicted of more Does anyone on here make that claim If so do you have any evidence showing it to be true If not what is the reason you believe said claim,Does anyone have any evidence of the common claim black people commit more crimes than non black people,0

When Biden address the situation he s very careful with his words He specifically states that the war would be between Urkraine and Russia but that the international community would condemn their invasion He doesn t state that the US would get involved but he does sort of imply it Do you think America would go to war for Urkraine if Russia decides to invade,What will America do if Russia invaded Urkraine,0
I am not Canadian but I understand they have some kind of charter However I have recently learned that they have a special tool that can use to overturn democracy whatever that means That is emergency powers So how would you classify Canadian political system now Is it a police state or something else Has democracy been suspended until parliament deems it acceptable to have one again Has parliament passed laws to outlaw peaceful protests in the same way that Singapore has or are there differences I am looking for more than just yes or no answers As we do in the maths subreddits please show your working out Thanks,Where can I learn more about the emerging political system in Canada,0
Given that Trudeau has introduced new emergency powers such as freezing bank accounts what else does it mean Does it mean that he has criminalised peaceful protests Could those emergency powers be kept in place indefinitely and could they be used to suspend possibly indefinitely the countries national or provincial elections Could these new emergency powers be used to override their charter or even human rights Given that Canada is a member of the commonwealth is it conceivable that any of this could be challenged in the high courts by the opposition party,Questions about Trudeau s new emergency powers,0
I m reading Prophets of War in which the author states the military likes to keep contractors from going bankrupt For example they mention Lockheed and Martin s horrendous record and still the military throws money at them over better contractors Why This assumes I correctly interpreted the author s statement,Why does the US military try to keep multiple contractors afloat,0

For instance if you were to run for office in Maryland I m just curious as to what would be possible,What environmental policies would you run on if you were to run for local office,0
It seems every epitome of political debate these days revolve around the notion of representative equality and the debate between those who prioritise equal opportunity and those who prioritise equal representation which is a stupid debate imao because the former should lead to the latter all else equal Would modern representative equality not then entail that if the masses are uneducated that the uneducated should rule them if taken to an extreme which so often does I m curious and not looking for a debate but something to settle this contradiction which it is because it just doesn t lead to a better society as a whole,Would modern equality demand that the uneducated rule the uneducated,0
It s not even like there s huge economic downside like criticizing China,Why does so much of the world stay silent about Russia invading Ukraine For example Africa Latin America,0
If Russians bend under sanctions and they stand up against the regime and its decision Putin s regime will almost certainly suppress or even violently try to silence the anti government positions In such a case the West would likely have no justification not to act as not so look like they support such atrocities If Russia were invaded and defeated would the country break up into different regimes even at least for a certain term before reunification Would China try and take a few chips out of Russia and claim it as territory How would these territories form in terms of strategic border formation Would these state form their socioeconomic an political ideologies around something opposite to what the previous Russian regime had something fused with democracy I know these are a bunch of questions pressed into one post but they all seem relevant,If Russia were to be invaded for whatever reason would there emerge breakaway states,0
I want to preface this with a bit of backstory but I ll try to keep it light I befriended some Dem socialists and an Anarcho Com some years ago and at the time I was a centered libertarian Me not being able to lie told them flat out that this was the case For the first entire year I knew them we would have these back and forths with debating It only ever wasn t civil or times but I feel like part of that came from me being afraid of using the wrong words and having a hard time phrasing things favorably In that time I just couldn t help but notice that they NEVER seemed uncertain of anything political Recently I shifted over to socialism as well and while I do feel like I had some bad opinions back then I don t think I was an idiot In fact I ve always felt that doubt and self reflection are essential aspects of growth as an individual and I m thankful that I did because I have changed since then That being said I ve developed this intense hatred towards the rich and America at large that coincided with formally adopting socialism I don t like being a hateful person and I think that universal empathy is important but it s hard to not feel like the world is going down the drain because of the systems we have in place To that end I ve even noticed that my friends have all but given up hope on a better future for the country and the world at large I just flat out refuse to think this way regardless of which way the evidence points to because I d rather believe that a better life is possible and pursue that goal than simply resign and develop a bitterness towards life though I understand why that happens I d rather think of ways to persuade dissidents to join the cause even if compromises have to be made than just die gritting my teeth,Can a political ideology really inform a personality,0
Putin s prospects seem to get worse and as he ages what has he got to lose but attempt to trigger the collapse of the US like his beloved USSR collapsed From a purely objective standpoint if we all were a year old and aging putin facing a dynamic china with a young leader a teetering US with an ironclad ally system and a Russia desperately stifled by antiquated dependency on fossil fuels wouldnt we just launch WW since were gonna die anyway Putin has an absurd amount of power and very very little to lose right and at least he could go out obliterating his moral foes right What is stopping him,Is nuclear war obviously imminent,0
Please note that this question is not fueled by an anti vax ideology In fact I m looking for examples that will help me engage in more effective debate on that topic,Aside from vaccination what s an example of a government mandate of a developed nation requiring that citizens must alter the natural physiology of their body,0
Is there a way to methodically learn about the dependency relations between countries composition of their political spectrum etc without just reading news articles as they come by,How do I systematically study the current world order,0
I am non Canadian and living outside of Canada so I am currently trying to just see this as a cautionary tale but I am not sure what the learned lessons are here yet and there are a couple of things I haven t managed to get straight in my mind Is it true that the Trudeau led administration has passed a law making it illegal to help truck drivers with diesel or food How does one pass a law like that without running foul of human rights laws The videos I have watched have shown the convoy leaders telling everyone to protest peacefully and avoid violence even during seizures of what could be argued is the property of the convoy Realistically is there any kind of peaceful legislative process that might give them opportunity to sit down a the negotiating table with Trudeau or can they be banned permanently from access to a grievance tribunal How might this play out if Trudeau continues to demonize the convoy as treasonous insurrectionists Would such a charge be taken seriously via the judiciary in Canada or is just posturing and political grandstanding Thanks,What can we learn from the reaction of Trudeau s government to the Freedom Trucker Convoy,0
Disclaimer I live in the US and am liberal I feel like Fox News is a big reason why we have so many hard right voters I wonder if other countries are in the US s situation where Fox News is pretty much the most watched news network I feel like that s a big reason why those countries are more progressive that they might lack that type of channel I know the UK has its issues What about the more stereotypical left wing countries,Do liberal counties like Sweden Germany etc have new channels equivalent to Fox News,0
To me this is very clearly a space where the public owns it and it also seems like a space where types of renewable energy and storage can be installed It seems like even the materials the shelters are made from not only are more expensive but not as good as advances made in the last years in materials science I see so many homeless and it makes me sick we don t create enough shelter for everyone to avoid deaths due to exposure I see these things called shelters and it seems to be that they fit the very lowest definition of one It may break the wind coming from one direction but it certainly won t reliably keep the cold or heat out Why don t we treat these pieces of infrastructure like the public good they could be,Why do we still tolerate unheated public bus and other types of shelters,0
Every U S territory has been owned for years and I was wondering why they haven t become states yet I can understand D C not becoming one with the intent being no state has the U S capital in it but the others As far as I know they ve all requested statehood but been denied What s stopping this from being the case,Why have U S territories not become states yet,0
The TLDR question is in the title The longer version of the question and the backstory as is follows Some cities in the US have considered tracking foreign ownership of residential real estate in part to get a better idea of its impact on real estate prices At least one member of the Seattle City Council asked the King County Assessor for hard data on this topic but the KC Assessor said that wasn t his offices job and they didn t have the data or the resources to get that data Since Seattle is fairly close to Vancouver BC and Vancouver BC taxes foreign ownership at a different rate than domestic ownership some in Seattle had wondered if they could do something similar This idea was eventually squelched by the Seattle City Attorney that said US Treaty laws forbid states or cities from having special taxes on foreign owned property they must be taxed at the same rates as domestic property by states amp counties any special taxes can only be implemented at the federal level I might be paraphrasing a bit but that was the gist as I recall I m sure one of the reasons we allow foreign ownership of US real estate is because we want other nations to allow ownership of their real estate by US entities and so reciprocity would suggest if we want the right to own property in places like Mexico or Canada or Spain etc then we must also allow entities from those nations to own property in the US Beyond this what are the other reasons that we allow foreign ownership of US real estate and property I am aware that both Canada and Mexico place some restrictions on what they allow Canada taxes foreign ownership at a higher rate Vancouver does anyway and Mexico allows foreign ownership of land only in certain areas and makes other areas off limits to foreign ownership Could the US do any of what Canada or Mexico are doing without violating our Treaty agreements In short if they can do it why can t we To be clear I m not advocating that we should change our policy I m just asking for the political and hence legal reasons why our policies are the way they are,What are the advantages to the US economy of allowing foreign ownership of land and real estate in the US should we change this,0
During his campaign Trump said he would like to normalize relations with Russia and possibly even cooperation with them During his presidency though Trump did the opposite and was even more hawkish on Russia than his predecessor Instead of lifting old sanctions he kept them in place as well as implemented new ones Instead of moving American forces away from the Russian border he sent in more He attacked Russia s allies Syria and Iran He even opposed European countries buying Russian oil and gas Why the Was this campaign promise just meant to get the anti war voters,Why did Trump flip on Russia,0
Hi recently I embarked on a journey to construct a rock solid political worldview and in order to do that I realised I would have to read some politics which I don t have a problem with Of course I do already have some political intuitions and I have been watching political and especially philosophical content on youtube for the past few years but of course my goal is to ground those said intuitions What I realised is that if I wanted to start reading politics I would first have to start reading philosophy on which I can ground my political worldview and this is where the question comes in At first I figured I should just go through the most influential books in philosophy after getting some sort of introduction so I first read a basically philosophy textbook and I ve already ordered Russel s history of western philosophy after which I had a list that looks something like Republic Metaphyiscs Hume Descartes Mill Rawls Kant Rousseau etc A problem I have with this approach though is that although I enjoy philosophy as something akin to a hobby ultimately I am looking to just get to the politics part and don t care too much about epistemology and the such so I thought what if I just read a lot of ethics like Justice Sandel Mill and Rawls then some more focused works and I can save a lot of time that way without losing much Do you find the latter approach as rushed and heretical or would it be a good shortcut Thanks in advance,I would appreciate some advice,0

What could the president actually do From my understanding the president has to make most decisions through Congress and isn t actually allowed to do much single handedly I know he could also declare war without Congress permission or at least initiate conflict but I m not too sure about that Is the president actually able to put a hit on someone Does the president get things for free if he goes to a restaurant store business etc I know he isn t able to go anywhere by himself or even allowed to drive anywhere off government property but is he allowed and capable of going anywhere in the country Visit any allied countries just to visit Does he have enough power and influence to get a business company completely closed barred or blacklisted Is he allowed to put anyone in prison and get anyone out of prison as long as it s federal and not state Could he really have people taken and sent away somewhere if he wanted How does his power and influence compare with others in different countries like say Russia s or London s political power and influence over their countries I know some countries have more authoritarian control over their countries What about the Queen of Britain How much power does she actually have in her respective country I know the majority of decisions go through a system similar to Congress Just tryna learn more about what political figures can and can t do even if they don t usually do it Thanks,How much power does the President of the United States actually have What about in relation to the other countries,0

Why does Trump want to be president again I understand the variety of reasons he might have wanted to be president the FIRST time around but given rumors and reporting after that first election he may never really have wanted or expected to actually win in in the first place There s a variety of easy answers because he doesn t like losing or to stay out of jail but to me they all seem overly simplistic given the hard work and scrutiny that he faces attempting to run again Isn t running again just going to make him even more of a target Wouldn t he be best served by moving towards some kind of pundit status What are some thoughts,Why does Trump want to be president again,0

Hi there We have been reading about the importance of Pivoting to Asia for some years now and Asia rising economies is often the cited reason IMF or World Bank estimations have high projections for Asian countries e g Indonesia and some mention that Asian economies would account for of world GDP e g vs EU But If we look at GDP per capita projections Asian economies are not the majority of the top countries So sure Asian countries would have strong activity within their economies but for an Asian person it is probably better to move to a country with a good GDP per capita projections e g Norway for personal wealth My question is what is the impact of rising Asian economies on the rest of world Lets say you are a high skilled worker how do you prepare for this rise,Why Pivot to Asia is important,0

The US congress is divided into the house and the senate and the difference between the two is that one takes into account the population of each state and the other one doesn t As I understand it this was also the case in many state legislatures that were modeled after the congress However after the Reynolds v Sims Sims case many states were forced to redraw the electoral districts for both the upper and lower body of their state legislatures so that all the districts had roughly the same population It seems to me like this would make state level bicameralism pointless as the upper and lower house in most state legislatures are both elected by districts with equal population and representation unlike the US congress where the difference between the house and the senate remains as originally intended,What s the point of bicameralism in US state legislatures,0

Basically is the governent somewhat transparent with us or do they have secret malicious agendas and theyre keeping tons of secrets of us I m asking this because I had a conversation with a friend where they told me that Covid was made in a lab funded by the American govt and that vaccines are mandated to control the people They told me more things that they think the govt is hiding from us but I was pretty suprised by him because that level of conspiracy in the govt is serious right Don t get me wrong I know the American govt has done shitty things but is it really to that level of grand conspiracy Aren t there laws that require the govt to disclose certain info to the public Idk my general idea was that the govt had secrets obviously but that it was mostly transparent with us But since so many people around me think otherwise to the point where they dont believe anything the govt or scientists say I don t know what to believe anymore,How much should the American government be trusted,0
If peace was to achieved how about Ukraine was to remain geopolitically neutral from both the West and Russia This means they won t enter NATO or make formal trade agreements with the EU and the US but at the same time would not join Russian trade alliances or security arrangements Could this neutral Ukraine depend on other countries like China Japan and South Korea for trade and security if they can t join either the Western or Russian bloc,What if Ukraine was to remain neutral,0
I have heard of this and intuitively it does make sense because globalisation allows countries to influence each other but I am curious if it is verified whether outside influence indeed led Saudi Arabia to their liberalisation With this idea in mind is it a better alternative then to continue trading with countries despite poor human records instead of sanctions Because from what has been seen thus far is that it is the people who are hurt more by sanctions than the political elites who are easily insulated from the consequences,Is it true that continuing relations with Saudi Arabia despite its poor human rights records is partly attributed to the kingdom s recent liberalisation Is continuing relations better than sanctions,0

Just as modernity grew from the foundations set by medieval europe Which built itself upon the ashes of the Roman empire who themselves appropriated Greek culture tho in turn adopted Persian and Ionian philosophy etc If some catastrophe resulted in the fall of the major governments of the modern civilization to a point that no outside power would just take over what would be the appropriate result How much industry would could remain What institutions would survive and govern humans the relics of modern society What aspects of modernity would be vilified or deified in the future How if at all would courts rights law trade function Would humanity slowly go extinct due to our inability to handle industrial technology in a governmentless world,If western society violently collapses what government will remain,0
My initial impression was that the VP could break a tie for an appointment to the Supreme Court in much the same way that they might break a tie on legislation However Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe has previously argued that the VP cannot do this when it come to the Senate acting in its capacity to advise and consent bold added gt While the vice president has the power to cast a tiebreaking vote to pass a bill the Constitution does not give him the power to break ties when it comes to the Senate s Advice and Consent role in approving presidential appointments to the Supreme Court gt gt You don t have to take my word for it Alexander Hamilton said the same thing way back in in Federalist No In the national government if the Senate should be divided no appointment could be made Hamilton contrasted that rule with how appointments worked back then in his home state of New York where the governor actually did have the power to break ties to confirm nominations to New York state offices gt gt Consistent with Hamilton s understanding as two thoughtful recent scholarly analyses have pointed out no vice president in our history has ever cast a tiebreaking vote to confirm an appointment to the Supreme Court There s more at the link going into the specifics of the argument and why allowing the VP to break a SCOTUS nomination tie would be unconstitutional My question is is Professor Tribe right,Does the US Constitution allow the VP to break a tie on SCOTUS appointments,0
I haven t really been able to look into the details and I m not sure if this was the national bill or something proposed at a state or smaller level but my parents mentioned something about this They said democrats wanted to make it so easy to vote that you didn t need ID You just needed to show up and give your name Thus allowing someone to pose as another person and cast many votes Example Joe who knows that Ben hasn t voted yet and shows up to Ben s local voting center impersonating him Then Joe is able to cast a vote as Ben simply by telling them his name is Ben Is this really possible under what was being proposed,Did the recent voting rights bill that was proposed in the US really allow people to vote just by giving their name and no proof of identification,0

This is focused on Europe specifically but feel free to answer if you can I m from Hungary a little middle eastern european country We live under a very bad and corrupt government with really extreme populism Our schools never been good but over the last few decades it really shows The media alnost completly under governmental control All these result in a very divided very uneducated country Fake news and conspiracies travel like wildfire Now to my question Many who migrated to western european countries like Germany Netherland France Great Britain and so on have told me that the life there much more peacful With actual work you can live decently The schools are great Everyone willing to get vacinated Except not everyone I often read about anti vaccine riots and conspiracy theories spreading like wildfire Many people are homeless or live in a very poor conditions Not just imigrants If the political culture the education and the overall well being of people are so high several happiness rankings lower corruption and less governmental control over the media How come that there are still so many conspiracy theorists and poor I know that there s a lot of generalisation in my question However the reason I ask this because we think in Hungary that if the education would met the european standards corruption would be lower and media freer than the country could change significantly However it seems that the rise of populism is global we just experience it first Hans,How people in western european countries live happier while at the same time populism and conspiracy theories are on the rise,0

Was searching for a list to reconcile with certain higher level constructs but could not find a comprehensive or consolidated list Initial thought was what single issue voting topics are derived from or strongly correlated with belief systems such as Christianity humanism capitalism etc etc etc A few examples are Pro life choice equal rights guns CRT animal rights environment death penalty economy gay marriage small government amp xB Food for thought rambling As an independent voter in the US my party association at any given time could in theory be determined by assigning weights to each unique issue and then comparing my weights to the estimated weights of each party and selecting based on a summation fit If someone primary belief system is Methodist Christian faith there is likely a large weight associated with pro life and traditional marriage issues Do these people generally care less about the environment Statistically probably yes But is that determined directly by their belief system or by their association with a party that places a lower emphasis on their environment which they associate with because of their huge weights in the previously mentioned issues What about capitalism as a belief system The bible says you can not serve both God and money yet conservatives tend to be both more religious and in support of free market enterprise Would we see the same patterns on a less macro scale If all knowledge of political parties were to be wiped from voters minds total reset would free market capitalists and Christians still vote in tandem Root cause analysis for single issue voters is where this question arose from,What are the most common single issue voting issues,0

Many people felt that Trump was less willing to be hard on Russia in having its way with some even thinking he was beholden to Putin in some way Trump did little to dissuade us of this being that his comments about Putin ranged from neutral to glowing always hesitant to openly state that Russia and its leader were adversaries Trump supporters felt that the Trump Putin connection was being overblown and was a witch hunt etc Almost immediately after Biden was sworn in my friend started telling me see Putin is testing Biden as proof of his belief that Trump actually was strong against Russia and Biden is will be weak Initially I was skeptical But fast forward to now and we are at an obvious geopolitical impasse where Putin has spent the last few months blowing way past testing into fully daring America and the entire world into stopping his invasion of Ukraine I framed this question around the US political relationship because I d like to see what if anything we can learn about the assumptions people made on both sides of the political spectrum about how dangerous Trump may or may not have been for geopolitical stability I recognize that the timing of this invasion depends on numerous factors and who is in power in America is but one of them but it s an undeniable one So if Putin would have been more likely to have his way with Trump as president why didn t he do this then Would he have been more likely to Might it be that he would have been more likely to but other factors made him wait until this presidency,With respect to the US political relationship why would Putin invade Ukraine now,0

For example I imagine foreign policy except for scuppering the Iran Nuclear deal not being too different if Hillary Clinton a hawk and friend of Kissinger and the Bush era neocons won in It s easy to imagine Kasich moderate Republican appointing the exact same supreme court justices that Trump did and doing similar tax cuts and budget cuts to government agencies amp xB But neither of them would have denied the election results or suggested that drinking cleaning products might cure Covid,From a progressive perspective what of Donald Trump s negative policies and actions in office would have happened under President Hillary Clinton what would have happened under President Kasich and what was unique to President Trump,0
This question is obviously controversial but bear with me because we re all curious Courts in general tend to favour the mother in custody cases But men can still properly raise a child if mothers aren t around Women take large financial and psychological risks when they have to raise a child by themselves and would be much less inclined to have another child If these children were to be legally assigned to the father the women could yet re marry and conceive more children while the fathers raise the original children while allowing mothers to be part of their lives This is only a hypothetical question and likely never to come te realisation unless the state is controller by an extreme authoritarian government or something But would you say this is a valid point,If countries struggle with dwindling populations why not change the court system to award all custody to the fathers,0

Hey guys I m in highschool so I ll admit I m not the most knowledgeable on political stuff Sites like chan r conspiracy and theDonald seem like they re causing serious damage Is there really nothing that can be done here Like I get that free speech is important but at what point can a common understanding be reached to you know not lead people to hurt others terrorize overthrow the gov etc This scares the crap out of us Surely there is some kind of limit right I mean you can t threaten a judge why can t we extend that sort of thinking to this It seems sensible to me I d love to read about exactly how legally constrained the government is here It looks like it s getting worse by the day,Is there anything the US can do to stop toxic sites without infringing upon free speech,0

Broad trend I noticed around the world is electing populist leaders who ignore expert advise Examples I could think of are Jair Bolsonaro from Brazil Rodrigo Duterte from Philippines and Donald Trump of US But their predecessors are described as technocrats Why the sudden change in this election trend Yes I do remember years ago of the so called anti expertism which intersects with the rising populism at the time But surely countries have their own peculiarities and problems which doesn t necessarily relate to another country So why has there been anger at the perceived expertism when in the previous generation of many national governments people have elected technocrats before,Why is there a change from electing technocratic leaders to populist ones in the past years,0

This was a comment I posted in another thread but I thought it might create an interesting dialog I have trouble understanding the motives of those that objected to the electors on January th From my understanding of the issue A lawyer named Eastman created a document that was used in an attempt to destroy our democracy Trump relied on it to create the structure that became the protest of the electors on January th Pence looking for a yes shopped it around to three other people before saying no Woodward book Peril Tweet from Judge Luttig How can someone claim to love America when they support the destruction of the union How can we have democracy if we openly petition to disenfranchise voters Those that stood up on January th and objected to the certification of electors should be questioned in public and in legislative proceedings Their motives were to overthrow America and I can t see how people celebrate those that supported the Eastman memo Or am I wrong and those that stood up are heroes to the cause If so what is the cause and how does it support the framework of the Constitution,Are the people that stood up and protested the electors on January th heroes or zeros,0

As I understand it those states had those spikes because largely pro Biden mail in ballots were processed all at once after other votes as is protocol thus allowing Biden to pull ahead later in the election day This explanation seems entirely reasonable to me so I ve always been very skeptical of the claims of voter fraud in the election that many Trump fans make And of course there s also the fact that the trump team s efforts in court were completely unsuccessful the audits the inconsistent claims from Trump officials in and outside of court and so on However for the first time I ve encountered a voter fraud claim which actually seems semi though out I m still very skeptical of it of course because of the aforementioned reasons but I didn t just want to dismiss it without understanding if the claim is true The claim was basically that only those crucial states Wisconsin Michigan Pennsylvania and Georgia saw those sudden spikes whereas other states the specific examples were Nevada California Illinois Maryland Arizona Indiana and Maine did not It s argued that that something uniquely fishy is therefore going on in those four states rather than a delay in counting mail in or urban area votes which one would expect to see consistently throughout the whole country Or at least that s the argument It s detailed in a public google doc here the doc isn t mine So back to my title question did any states aside from Wisconsin Michigan Pennsylvania and Georgia and also Nevada California Illinois Maryland Arizona Indiana and Maine if he s telling the truth about those states have similar pro Biden vote spikes presumably because of similar vote counting protocol Or is the protocol unique only to those crucial swing states purely out of coincidence Or is that doc wrong for some other reason Thanks for any help I really appreciate it,In the election were there any states aside from Wisconsin Michigan Pennsylvania and Georgia which had sudden spikes in Biden votes,0

A bold move wasn t it How different things would be had Yulia Timoshenko won that year and Yanukovych lost And yet notice how the western alliance did peanuts over it But lets place ourselves in that time We know that Medvedev was the actual president of Russia and Putin was prime minister Obama was in Washington and London had Labour PM Gordon Brown The Greeks had revolted and were threatening to abandon the European Union and perhaps this distracted Berlin and Paris together with ensuring the other mediterranean countries had stability Its very odd how the Euros and Anglos put little effort into that Ukrainian election Did they see Medvedev as cute and harmless Or did they perhaps feel interfering in Ukraine and supporting Timoshenko would perhaps backfire on them Where they just too busy At any rate the interference in caused Yanukovych to win and four years later Putin once again president was able to flip Crimea and snatch it Im pretty impressed by this But more so how nonchalant and apathetic the western alliance was Why did they just sit back and let it happen,Why was the Western alliance so weak at interfering in the Ukrainian election,0

I don t think there is anything they can actually do to you if you don t pay beyond wage garnishments I m sure they can t imprison you for refusing to pay Garnishments might even be cheaper then paying them back As for the inevitable ruining our credit well does that really matter if the climate crisis really gets going Our country almost fell due to a virus that should be easy for us to handle I don t know what happens when that ice shelf finally gives way but it sounds like it s going to be a global event That s happening in under years So when someone talks about credit ratings I point to things like my camper as real security,Could we refuse to pay student loans until the climate crisis is dealt with To start until the build back better bill was passed and until burning coal was outlawed,0
I am typing this in English so that more people can read this I am years old only and reside in Siberia so if this is stupid I am apologize Yesterday my grandfather was explaining the situation with our country and Ukraine to me and I just did not understand why everyone was angry at us about the situation How is it fair for the USA and Nato to have troops stationed right at Russia s boarder and in Ukraine when if we tried stationing our forces in Mexico or somewhere near us boarders America would definitely not allow it and probably say it is an act of war or something This is not a rant I am genuinely asking because I do not know if this is just how things are or if there is some rule I do not know of I am just curious my grandpa explained this to me and it just did not seem fair to our country because nato and the USA are doing the same thing to our country and our boarder It seems NATO and everyone is mad at us for doing the same thing they are doing Not to mention all the troops they have stationed across the globe I am just confused about it all I would love for someone inform me,Why is everyone mad at our country about Ukraine,0

As someone in their early twenties who identifies as both a progressive humanitarian and even is open to the label of socialist I am increasingly concerned about how many people my age or younger are accepting of communism Not just Marxism in the sense of economic justice or class consciousness but people feed into Soviet Communist propaganda these days more and more often despite its history of genocide famine and authoritarianism I found myself falling down the rabbit hole for a moment because I liked the communal principles of anti capitalism and anti white supremacy but when you actually study communism s history and theory I quickly see it s unworkable and dangerous Does anyone else see this trend or am I just on the wrong side of the internet I just saw a TikTok of a young girl showing off her collection of communist literature and it had likes Why is this so popular Do we lack a comprehensive education of communism as a result of the Red Scare Is this rise in communist belief real and to what extent,How real is the rise of communist belief in the United States,0

Typically when we think of war we think of guns tanks and bombings However we live in a country that has crossed into the digital and information age Instead the weapons and munitions now are information based Maybe we don t fully realize that is what is happening and by calling it out we can look at this directly for what it is A civil war Perhaps in the future historians might look back and call this Red vs Blue politics a civil war in the information age If that fits what will future historians suggest as solutions to this problem What can anyone do besides stand and watch everything fall apart Does anyone see an end to this,Are we the US in a modern day Civil War,0

I m not anti immigration I am anti border wall as I don t think they work over the long term Why not legislatively increase the criminal cost for hiring illegal immigrants instead of building a wall Part of the fees and penalty could be used to help those hired become U S Citizens Which puts the burden on American business versus the people crossing While this plan requires a pathway for citizenship this plan could help reduce the numbers trying to cross the border as the incentive for employment is lessened NKtzRpbbc,Why build a wall at the border when punishing those that hire illegal immigrants may be more efficient,0
I was just talking about this with a friend Our conservative families believe STRONGLY in gun rights but it really makes no sense to us Our country spends nearly trillion year on defense and they honestly believe they haven t figured out a way to deal with some of the most mass produced consumer projectiles Wouldn t a better defense against a hypothetical tyrannical government be to get involved and work with your neighbors to create a better future Aren t they living on false hope by thinking they d stand a chance against a modern military with some basic projectile weapons I am a teen so I m probably naive and apologize But I really am confused by this lol,Highschool student here why do conservatives support gun rights so much,0
When I was in my early s I considered myself to be liberal After I graduated from tech school with a degree in Computer Support and Network Specialist I became more centralist Now that I m in my mid s and I notice how my interactions are with my right leaning friends VS my left leaning friends I get along much better with my right leaning friends They are actually there for me when I need them Whereas not from my left leaning friends If I can t help my left leaning friend right when they ask they get mad at me Fully expecting me to help them right then and there I can t help it all the time due to a chronic illness that I have Whereas my right leaning friends are much more flexible due to being understanding of my situation with living with a chronic illness Due to these interactions It s making me question about my political leaning I get along great with all my republican friends I see a victim mentality in my Democrat leaning friend which always pisses me off,Questioning my political leanings,0

At the moment few authoritarian countries are the one party states that we saw in the mid th century or the absolute monarchies of the th century Most modern authoritarian regimes after the Cold War have had a disguise of democracy regular voting multiple parties etc but behind the scenes they re heavily shaped in the incumbents favour and are a facade to the public Do you think this will be the new normal for authoritarian regimes for the rest of the st century or could a different form of regime one party state military junta become more common again,What do you think authoritarian regimes will look like in the next years or so,0

In my state and city the role of a judge seems similar to the role of a federal judge which is largely a review function and to oversee criminal and civil court cases and make sure that everything brought before them is within the confines of the law I noticed that in some other states the role of judges is more political and more public In my state judges are elected and each party puts up their nominee but once judges are elected there are strict non partisan guidelines they must follow I was recently watching something about the Kentucky storms and saw that one of the town s judges was speaking at the press conference Also after the Astroworld tragedy in Texas there was a judge who was speaking at the press conference Do different states have different rules for judges are they the most powerful person in some towns cities is it mostly small towns where judges have more power,Do Judges act more like an executive in certain parts of the country Role of Judges USA,0

Biden clearly has some cognitive decline and as such is a liability in ongoing talks concerning Ukraine But even though Biden is compromised he is hitting the right notes so far He s been doing this for years and it s rote and he doesn t contend with the pathological narcissism Trump does so he s capable of listening to his advisors Trump on the other hand when asked about election interference while in Putin s presence immediately buckled and slobbered on Putin s mutton dagger He said He Putin said it wasn t Russia I will say I don t know why it would be Russia It was pathetic weakness on a par with W becoming frozen with fear and indecision for long minutes after learning of the attacks It was clear that Trump needed the big strong man Putin to approve of him and view him as an equal a peer He desired such above the well being of the U S And he also didn t want to acknowledge anything even to the detriment to the U S which might mitigate the glory of his Presidential victory,Would you rather have Biden or Trump dealing with Putin,0

I haven t studied much on American policy and how all the political gears turn in the U S govt but was curious if a candidate had to have a certain net worth or something to be qualified In my experience I ve frequently heard that candidate must already have an in but nobody knows what that is while also adding that Americans often will remind one another that corruption is ramped in our country Can anyone shine some light on this,Are there unwritten standards criteria that United States Presidential candidates must meet to have a shot at presidency,0
In talks with a family member who grew up middle class in Monterrey a northern city in Mexico he discussed a global perspective and how there will always be winners and losers in any system and that American exceptionalism fueled big misunderstandings about how things function His point however was essentially that people who point to other developed nations around the world who still govern over people with human psychologies of course for something like universal healthcare miss the fact that what allows their cost effective programs has a relationship with the massive profits generated in the U S Essentially we re subsidizing the rest of the world because Company can sell product to other state and make up the profits in the U S How true is this objectively My prior thoughts are emerging from an anthropology class and part of the Land of Open Graves book which discusses how Prevention Through Deterrence policies do not meaningfully reduce immigration but they do force governments to spend inefficiently relative to public goals and then delegate to companies selling technology detention centers and so on who are then able to lobby the government or fund campaigns but that s out of sight out of mind and so is not a populist political topic,Perspectives on Globalization,0

So let s say that at some point someone decides to launch a real nuclear missile at another country This will most likely be met with response and a nuclear missile dropped back HOWEVER Most people assume this would for some reason spiral out of control and more nuclear missiles would be dropped Is it not more likely that at this point a stale mate will be reached Both sides will be shocked by what happened and realise that shit s for real and that nobody is bluffing and at that point just instantly start negotiating and deescalating the situation It will be a catastrophic event but not world ending It is even possible that first nukes will be of small scale and at that point they will just freeze the conflict because red line will be crossed and all parties will know escalating further means world end Why do people assume sides will just keep launching more and more nukes instead knowing it will eliminate everything Which scenario do you think is more likely and why,Isn t threat of nuclear war overrated e What would actually happen,0
Instead of blindly following the party platform from top to bottom I m sure they can find people that are more suited to the district they re running in Obviously a Trump like Republican will likely never win in a state like Maryland However someone like Larry Hogan could Joe Manchin is also another good example Instead of trying to find pure candidates that just follow party lines why not look for important issues to the constituents in that district If someone aligns with of the party s interests but not the other because he she is better catered to the constituents wouldn t that be more ideal than just chalking an area up to only voting one way I don t know Maybe that s just me I don t see white rural Alabama as being impossible for a Democrat to win with the right messaging and issues being talked about some conservative ideals being compromised for Just a thought for our government to be more representative and less polarized,Why do the main political parties in the US not run candidates more catered to certain states districts,0
So in my eyes the left to right discourse always focused around imbalance of power money the balance between workforce and corporations etcetera Sometimes there were these outburts like occupy wallstreet and stuff But years a go suddenly the discourse changed and the main focus became identity politics People having extremely inflamed debates about these subjects that were already really important for years but suddenly surfaced hard Maybe it had to do with the internet giving voices to these people that were dispersed and suddenly gave them a way to group up etcetera The concententration of wealth and stuff is much less talked about in comparison,Why did identity politics become so big the last years and class conflict became less of a thing,0
In Liberalism A Very Short Introduction he says gt Moreover liberal practices on the ground have institutional consequences and those consequences are woven into a grand and sometimes self congratulatory historical tapestry Many of those practices are contained in the phrase liberal democracy As a principle of good government liberal democracy has firm roots in numerous countries and is an aspirational goal in others It has a clear message democracy if by that we mean the rule of the people is all well and good but winning elections and popular government on their own are merely a minimum kit That kit is necessary but insufficient for a political system to be called liberal Liberals maintain that democracy must display additional characteristics for it to be considered a worthy system of government Democracy needs to be fair tolerant inclusive restrained and self critical not simply the pursuit of majority rule Liberal democracy involves not just elections but free elections It involves not just representative government but accountable and constrained government It involves not just the right to vote but the equal and unsupervised right to vote And it involves attention to the well being of all the members of a society a principle that requires some governmental activity but may be open to different interpretations The qualities liberals demand are extensive and varied it is a lot easier to preach liberalism than to realize it gt Liberal practices affect constitutions the degree of openness permitted in political debate and the basket of rights that societies are willing to distribute among their members Often too they involve ambitious schemes of redistributing wealth to increase the life chances of all although some commentators usually from a conservative or libertarian perspective might deplore that as a form of socialism And as usually is the case with any ideology a gap may open up between declared principles and effective practice Liberal principles may be breached even by those subscribing to them and some societies reject them out of hand In that case we may have to decide whether liberal principles or liberal practices bring us closer to identifying what is typical of liberalism Assessing liberalism is not an armchair intellectual activity though there is nothing wrong with that It relates rather to what kind of politics a society engages in at the coalface I understand some parts of it that there is a divergence between liberal practice and liberal principles that liberals value liberal democracys etc but not others the other bits being what I think he s getting at If you were to sum this up in one or two sentences what would you say,What does Freeden mean here,0

I m was thinking about Russia invading Ukraine and the precedent we had in history with China invading Tibet Do you notice how there was lots of ramble and complaints against China at the time in yet today as of years later nobody cares about Tibet anymore there are no imposed sanctions on China because of Tibet occupation However the territory remains It s not like anyone will take Tibet away from China and it s not like Tibet has nuclear arms and the capacity to declare independence Ukraine seems similar lacking nuclear arms and strong allies not part of NATO Even if Russia s already awful economy suffers more for a few decades the long term gain will be EV positive as Russia will benefit from the expanded territory So while they will suffer a few decades of awful economy it s not like anyone will take Ukraine back from them because of the nuclear deterrent Taking this into account it almost seems that it makes sense to occupy territories and expand as much as possible even if the economy suffers from it for nuclear nations People will forget and forgive over time but the territory will remain What are your thoughts on this and has this been analyzed before,For nuclear nations what is best strategy long term focus on economy or territorial expansion,0

Hey so I m very left leaning I live in Canada and wonder how America is so backwards sometimes when they are against ma better gun laws etc etc However I don t understand why Democrats are against voter ID to vote Like here to vote in any election you have to produce forms of ID confirming you are who you say you are I prefer to use my health card drivers license and passport sometimes It helps secure that no one else can vote on my behalf So why is this seen as taking away ppls right to vote in the US Unless I m missing something it just prevents someone from stealing your ability to vote PLUS if you do make IDs mandatory Republicans have one less excuse for why they lose,Question for those against the voter ID laws mainly Democrats what is wrong with voter ID Laws,0

I ve never understood the Chinese government s need for censorship so I asked in what I thought was a respectful way the question at the end of this post Here s the post My questions were removed from from r Sino r GenZedong r China and even r AskReddit The moderators of r GenZedong sent me some weird message as well Here are screenshots What is so terrible about or disrespectful about the post below Comments from those supporting the ban would be appreciated and helpful POST Countries are different I get that So I m not passing judgment on stuff like single party rule or the Chinese way of doing things One thing I can t get over though is the censorship Why does the Chinese government have to have a separate Internet and stop free speech So many of my possible misconceptions in China will vanish if the Chinese government doesn t censor Example The recent outrage of the disappearance of the Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai If there was complete freedom of speech without censorship this whole thing could have been cleared up in hours Any journalist could have simply walked up to her house and interviewed her then posted the interview on Twitter or Reddit Problem solved Instead of that we had to rely on formally released letters approved by the government That s not a good look And even now after videos showing her moving around there s always a doubt because a journalist can t just interview her and tell China and the whole world that she s ok Example The whole Uighur situation With complete free speech anyone could just walk up to a so called camp video tape everything then post it on Youtube If there s nothing going on it would be super easy to find out the truth Can that happen right now This is my biggest problem with the Chinese government Free speech and no censorship in the long run fosters trust To Clarify To clarify I m talking about government censorship I see many people here saying that the US also censors stuff when what they mean is that the US media doesn t cover everything or is biased That is not censorship Censorship is when the government forcibly removes or bans content In the US the government doesn t own any media so censorship is not possible,Banned from China Subreddits Where to Ask Chinese People Respectful Questions,0

Seriously it s so zero sum these days It s like it s a war People are fighting to wipe out the other side trying to get their side into power talking all blue wave this and red wave that and then think the world is over when their side doesn t win You just see both sides flinging shit at each other calling them out for different things when they have no moral leg to stand on People are so entrenched in the idea that you believe in this ergo you vote for this person this size The other side might have some ideas you agree with but you don t know it because your side paints them as the enemy someone who wants to destroy you so you have to vote for this person so you can destroy them All while people call out how biased the other side is in where they get their news as if their own side were any less biased I remember seeing an infographic saying that the far right and far left were the ones flinging shit at each other while the more centered ones were just wishing everyone would shut up and are more willing to hear the other side out about the policies they have that work and vice versa I don t believe that s the case anymore To hell with civility If you don t win this next election you re doomed There is no opportunity to make things better it ll only get worse So win by any means necessary It depresses me I don t believe in the good of humanity anymore I feel it can only get worse A part of me does still wonder if things CAN get better For things to not be so divisive anymore eventually,Would it ever be possible for politics to not be so divisive,0

I m wondering if it s even possible anymore for the ccp to collapse they have a strong grip on new generations are buying and building huge financial projects in Africa and the middle east I m just wondering if it s even possible for it to collapse anymore near future it just feels like they got to a status of too big to fail and that no one can do anything about it Am I wrong Is it still possible How and could it happen before they contribute too much to the fucking up of the planet for example,Will the ccp ever collapse,0
Please help me understand this I m not anti vax clearly As it is Covid is a virus that is only half as mutagenic as the Flu but x more deadly This is the facts Since it s a virus we can expect that Covid will continue to exist as a threat of some level probably higher than the Flu And like the Flu we will probably be urged to take a yearly vaccine during the season that Covid is the most powerful just like with the Flu In an ideal world everyone would have gotten a vaccine that seemed the safest seems to be pfizer after waiting a bit to temper doubts of side effects Then the Covid vaccine would have gotten yearly funding like the Flu vaccine does But if this is not the case why would you go about fixing this with a lockdown Primarily we have evidence that people who are vaccinated spread the virus just as unvaccinated people do They just don t die or arrive at the hospital MUCH less Thus lockdowning the unvaccinated will do nothing to stop the spread It s hard to enforce and will require constant authoritarianism to enforce Meanwhile if such authoritarianism is on the table a vaccine mandate is a one time infringement on rights that would greatly boost the safety of the country so that most people who do get it don t die reducing the danger down to a normal Flu Should that not be the goal Is the Austrian government actually that incompetent or is it legitimately the result of a government trying to take greater control All this does is feed into the anti vaxxers victim complex I think anti vaxcers are insane but this is also insane Why is Austria doing this,Why would Austria do a lockdown for the unvaccinated rather than a vaccine mandate At that level of authority you may as well go with the better and less controlling option,0

Hi first time poster If you care to know I consider myself socially liberal amp fiscally conservative I come here because I hope to get some different perspectives on the topic First off I don t intend to have the subject come off as a loaded question but I really can t think of any other way to write it From what I ve seen it looks like many Charter Schools are quite successful as an alternative to public schools And Democratic voters are for Charter Schools It s quite common to see Republican candidates champion Charter Schooling and without saying also are highly for School Vouchers But then you look at the Democratic Leaders there s no other way to put it they re largely indifferent if not hostile to Charter Schooling This article from Ballotpedia shows it President Joe Biden said he s against Charter Schools and talked that he d ban federal funding of them saying it siphons off money from Public Schools Bernie Sanders declared that he would ban Charter Schools because they re run by for profit companies From my count only of the Democratic Candidates showed support for Charter Schools Cory Booker Bill Weld Mark Sanford and Andrew Yang And only Booker is currently in elected office The rest didn t mention it or Ballotpedia failed to find their stance or they downright opposed it I already have the conservative knee jerk answer Democrats receive strong support from Teachers Unions so it s in their best interests to make said unions happy But Democratic leaders have shown the ability to not be controlled by unions I mean they chose Green Energy over the Coal Miners union It just seems really wrong to me that the party heads would go against something that the public is largely for And in July House Democrats called to cut funding for Charter Schools html Personally I think that s downright despicable I feel all families should have an alternative to Private Schools Not just the rich ones who can afford the tuition rates of Private Schools,Why are Democratic Politicians seemingly against or apathetic to Charter Schools,0

For example Give Caesar What is Caesar s and God s What is God s should you interpret that God commands the separation of church and state and also considers the state to be legitimate and therefore opposed to any form of anarchism Do you know of any other Bible quotes that explain that these are God s commands for human society to be organized politically And does this quote about Cezar and God do not forbid the theocratic political establishment and therefore the Vatican state is contrary to the Bible And can t you interpret the Bible so that only Caesar or only the Monarch is a legitimate ruler and therefore the Republican regime is at odds with the Bible And as for the Old Testament so Christians should not follow the principles in it and accept for example the Mosaic law of the Jews,Do you think that some passages in the New Testament should also be interpreted in a political context and that the Bible also prescribes some political principles as the Old Testament or the Qur an often does,0
I don t get it I m not a total liberal but I m not a conservative by any means Most of my views are liberal but I do agree with some conservative beliefs I thought that made me a centerist but I don t think that s it Is their like some place I can find out what party I m actually apart of,How do I find out what Poltical Party I belong to,0

Recent revelations on the events and meetings leading up to Jan th attack strongly suggest the attack was planned and orchestrated by Trump campaign political operatives employees of the executive branch and GOP congressional representatives If it can be shown that the capital riot insurrection violent attack on the Capital and Electoral Vote certification procedure was planned and orchestrated by those involved in the pre attack meetings is there a path for any of them to be criminally prosecuted Question mainly applies to the congressional and Senator representatives but really for all involved The congressional committee is not a judicial inquiry but if they find evidence of criminal conspiracy can any of the categories trump campaign employed executive branch employees congressional staff congressional senate representives be prosecuted,Are any of the congression reps who participated in planning the January th attack on the capital at risk for criminal charges,0

Nothing beyond sunlight is free Everything requires work and resources to be done Education health care food and housing are some of the things I ve heard should be provided to everyone But teachers doctors farmers and carpenters gotta eat too The rich don t want to be taxed and they get clear government representation to make sure it stays that way The poor can barely support themselves they are the ones requesting those things in the first place cause they can t afford it If the middle class were taxed they would start needing those resources too You can t have enough of what you don t have enough of So where would it come from Who s gonna pay the teachers doctors farmers and carpenters to provide the education health food and housing Now I know there are more empty houses than there are homeless people But those empty houses have legal owners and it is clear that those owners don t want to rent out the houses for the price the homeless can afford So where will the money come from,Those who want things for an adequate standard of living to be free where will that money come from,0

First off I m not American so this isn t front page news for me so my bad if it s really obvious and I m being an idiot So I m seeing a lot of blame being thrown on Joe Biden for making fuel prices high across the US and the entire world for rush matter The main cause being he reportedly shut down local production of oil Now I ve been doing a fair bit of searching for any information on this and I have come up with absolutely nothing The only things I can see are Biden tried to halt new leases but it was blocked by a federal judge And the oil production numbers haven t dropped by half as I ve seen claimed A small dip but fairly consistent So my question is this how exactly has he shut down local production and made gas prices so high I m seeing a lot of people parroting it but nobody seems to be able to provide a source Again I m not American I really don t care for Joe Biden I m just trying to sate my curiosity because so far I haven t been able to do it myself Thanks peeps Inb it s really obvious and I m a moron,How exactly has Biden Shut down production of oil,0

As one example I believe in near unregulated capitalism in one regard aspect of business but also believe in healthcare as a true human right without risk of bankruptcy If there were breakdowns on who believed in government funded college on a separate note do you think internal party policies would break idown as other topics have the libertarian party in their inability to choose a unifying platform en masse or would negotiations have to be made that make sense for everyone,If the US were to go multi party do you think there would be room for a limited socialist Democratic Socialist party,0
I remember that Trump decided to close travel off to and from China early on and everyone just sprouted up saying he was racist an xenophobic for doing so saying the virus was no big deal What would ve been a reasonable action for him to take that wouldn t have gotten him called a racist or a fascist,What should ve Trump have done slow stop Covid at the beginning that wouldn t get him slandered,0
So say somebody is paranoid and they just switch their political party to whatever political party the president s party is And say that certain minorities who emigrate from other countries where you d better be in the same party as the glorious leader do that Would politicians then pay more attention to that minority because that minority is full of swing voters What if people just switch parties to get information about the other party Because you get marketing materials from the party you re registered with Also and finally in states that are or nearly are single party states are candidates of lower quality on both sides I know that can t really be quantified but I would say it s true and I want to see if anyone agrees,Do politicians pay more attention to voters who switch from one party to another Is switching all it takes to get more attention Hypothetical situation in description,0

New to the sub I ve read the rules and previous posts or comments Is there anything in the proposed bill that would specifically introduce a new tax and or increase in percentage to those that do not qualify for the If you possess over billion or make million dollars a year tax bracket Particularly market assets belonging to normal people Probability aside in the next question If the bill is passed what would be a rough estimate of funds it would bring in How many of the roughly individuals that qualify at the moment allegedly and not those whom would make that bracket in the next years would stay in the United States vs leaving because they can afford to Elon Musk is quoted a lot obviously and I don t know if he would stay and pay or leave out of spite and meme potential Is there a reason for an investigation into the opposing Democrat Senators for taking bribes from people that this bill affect and presumably can afford to bribe Senators and Representatives If there could be a bi partisan agreement to actually hide something useful from the public for once Republicans would benifit from exposing Democrat Senators in swing states Assuming they re immune from anything else found and Democrats would just be happy to ditch the drag and get things done unanimously For the next three years,US I have three questions regarding the Democrats proposed increased taxation rate on wealthy citizens,0

I have been going around YouTube trying to find interesting english speaking channels that discuss interesting social issues to watch but whichever channel I end up watching I found that the content creator always either has a socialist agenda promoting fair wealth distribution and debunking religious fanatics BUT is inevitably supports liberal crap like LGBTQwerty and multiculturalism throwing the terms such as sexist racist and white privilege whatever those mean OR the content creator is conservative and might even be an atheist BUT will inevitably be against social welfare and promote the free market as a cure all There is also the less common third option where the content creator is both pro LGBT multiculturalism AND anti welfare pro free market I have not seen the obvious fourth option though I am yet to find anybody on the english side of the internet who is both a SOCIALIST and a CONSERVATIVE What gives This political alignment seems to be completely absent in the West Am I missing something or someone Do you know any content creators who fit this definition,Where are all the conservative socialists in the West,0

The first president to be impeached was Andrew Johnson About a century or so later Nixon is impeached and the time between his Clinton s and Trump s has each been significantly lesser Do you think leaders have become more apathetic in the modern era thinking they can get away with things more easily Or has modern technology created a greater degree of transparency Or is it a signifier of more partisan divisions I m sure many other presidents have done things worthy of impeachment and were never challenged or called out on it,Why has impeachment of presidents become more common in recent years,0

Let s look back at some memorable moments and interesting insights from last year Your top posts What campaign promises has Biden delivered on so far by u beedoopdeebop Do any of you just feel absolutely sick to your stomach when it comes to the state of US politics by u MLGRatboy Anyone miss this by u Woolier Mammoth How come Republicans keep telling people to vote red to stop free handouts and socialism but we spend nearly billion dollars giving farming subsides by u Justryan Why is trump or any president allowed to pardon people while they are impeached and facing a trial by u Sardonnicus Trump s Justice Department is finally saying what we already knew left wing protests turn violent at the incitement of right wing agitators and the biggest threat to our police is right wing extremists by u clocks for sale Today I learned that Fred Rogers of Mister Rogers Neighborhood was a lifelong Republican Where have the compassionate Republicans like him gone by u ffelix Why is no one talking about Biden s drone strike last month that killed innocent children and an aid worker by u wedookay What the heck is going on in the senate right now by u validusrex I just saw this on Facebook and I don t understand how is it that the senators won I m guessing it has something to do with Filibuster but I don t know what that is either Can someone explain please PS I m not American by u Darth Tatanka Thank you everyone for a great year,Happy Cakeday r Askpolitics Today you re,0

AOC went on record saying she was afraid of being raped if she was caught by the capitol rioters and that she doesn t think it s a stretch to say that many government officials would have been assassinated if they weren t evacuated and the rioters weren t driven out in time If Trump had convinced the military to work with him and overthrow the government what would happen long term Would the detention camps have turned into literal death camps Trump virtue signals to the far right all the time and his followers tend to rationalize his every action if their cognitive dissonance over the riot to begin with is any indication,What do you think would have happened if the Capitol Riot was successful,0
When I debated with the capitalists I found that they had a different definition than the opponents of capitalism And for example they did not consider any government intervention to be part of capitalism So for example they say that big banks are so powerful just because they operate with state printed money and therefore have unfair advantages that they would not have in a truly free market,How do capitalists define capitalism Do you agree with their definition And if not does it make sense to have a definition of your own that capitalists themselves do not accept,0

As a governing body it has shown to be corrupt and obstructionist Because representation is based only on the state rather than the population we have several almost empty states holding more power than states with the majority of the US population in them States as an entity should not hold the power that they do The HoR provides states with representative power for each state proportional to their population There is no purpose for the Senate to exist How do we get rid of it,What needs to be done to dissolve the Senate,0
I just finished watching president Bidens town hall with Anderson Cooper on CNN And during the video Biden takes a question from a professor about free community college being taken off of the bill and if it was what alternatives would be set up To which Biden responded they would possibly do something alternative such as award more in pell grant money which in my opinion is not even comparable to the help free community college would do for our society So my question is why is it that free community college or universal healthcare two things that would desperately improve our country so hard to achieve P S especially since the pandemic and current wealth divides it s mad that these two things health education are not provided to everyone,Why is universal healthcare and free community college so hard to achieve in the US,0

I identify on the left however I find that many on the left can be too idealistic and don t consider the cynical geopolitic and realpolitik Ideally we should de couple the government involvement on the military industrial complex but unfortunately defence contractors are some of the biggest employers in peripheral regions such as the American Southwest and Scotland in the UK That would mean shedding thousands of jobs in these regions that don t have strong competitive advantage and economies of scale What is the alternative to defense contract jobs I admit that I don t have any answer to that In international relations it is all too often repeated that countries don t do things out of pure kindness of their hearts and that countries don t have permanent friends only permanent interests The left demand to cut off relations or punish authoritarian regimes that the West are allied with or regimes that violate human rights and rightfully so However the left don t seem to realise that some of these regimes happen to have vital strategic resources and industries that the world depend upon such as the case with Saudi Arabia s oil or China s manufacturing industry providing the world with cheap goods we all take for granted and also these regimes don t care about public opinion which they could leverage along with their economic advantages to strong arm countries that defy against them Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau was morally right to call out Saudi Arabia but he eventually backed away when no other countries stood behind him This says a lot just how crucial maintaining relationship with Saudi Arabia despite being an authoritarian monarchy This is how cynical the world can be especially if the other party does not share the same values as you and have a lot more sway We are also presented with the trolley problem get rid of an industry that kill human beings and we save lives or make people lose their jobs and livelihood,In your own opinion do you think the left don t consider realpolitik and geopolitics,0

Yesterday the Czech Republic held a parliamentary election that appears to have defeated the scandal ridden Prime Minister One of the two alliances vying to replace the PM was the Pirates and Mayors alliance lead by the Czech Pirate Party The Czech Pirate Party is the most successful of the Pirate Parties which emerged in opposition to copyright restriction and in favor of an open internet The Czech Pirate Party expanded its platform to represent an anti corruption pro European platform with progressive social views and center to center left economics The Pirate Party was seen as having a very realistic shot at the Prime Minster s office The Pirates and Mayors alliance came in third with seats in line with polls but of those only went to the Pirates down from with going to the supposedly junior partner in the alliance So what happened Why did the Pirates lose so much support Why did the voters for the alliance choose the centrist Mayors and Independents party over the Pirates Was the English at least media wrong to report on the Pirates as the leading force in the alliance,What happened to the Czech Pirate Party,0

In America we make a big deal about separation of powers in the design of our national system so no single person can ruin it But this isn t completely foolproof state governors and legislators can be bad actors just as much as presidents and judges are often appointed by election or by elected legislators for partisan political gain and removal processes against incompetent actors underperform for their purposes Many countries follow a similar concept of separating duties and limited powers and checks against poor policymakers but every country has it s own systems and associated struggles What does your country do and does it work or not,How does your home country idiot proof its political system Does it succeed or fail,0

I m kind of assuming most people are at least vaguely aware of the presidental line of succession in US constitutional law Namely that if the president dies in office the vice president gets sworn in if he she is also dead or unable to serve the the Speaker of the house is sworn in etc on down the line If someone in the line of sucession is ineligible due to the requirements of the constitution they are skipped and it passes to the next person in line I ve recently watched two different TV shows that both deal with the complete destruction of the line of succession and the aftermath Designated Survivor Netflix three seasons show is complete in which the entire government is wiped out in a terrorist attack except one guy the secretary of HUD so he becomes president and Y The Last Man Hulu early in the first season but based on a graphic novel series of the same name from the early s in which all males on the planet die so the highest ranking eligible female known to be alive becomes president In both shows it is pretty quickly revealed that someone else survived in Designated Survivor the other survivors were behind the new president in the line so it s slightly irrelevant because even if they had known about these survivors he still would have became president In that show the new president was sworn in almost immediately within the same night of the attack What would they have done if they later found out one of the other survivors out ranked him and should have been president but he d already been sworn in This is never dealt with in that show since it didn t happen in that story but it s the exact scenario In Y The Last Man one survivor was unaccounted for and someone behind her was sworn in The show is only a few episodes in but other than explicitly talking about how it s going to be a conflict they haven t yet dealt with what the legal chalanges would be Semi related question if it s a terrorist attack or other major loss of life in which we can t even be sure how many or which people are dead like in Designated Survivor what kind of time line is there for swearing in a new president Does everyone in front of the sixth person in line have to be confirmed dead to get sworn in In the show the capitol building is bombed during the state of the union and realistically many of the bodies would literally never be positively identified and it may takes weeks to indisputably prove everyone else in line is dead At some point you just have to assume a person who was in the building when it blew up and hasn t been seen since is dead Obviously both of these shows will attempt to handle such matters realistically but they are still fiction so what would be the actual steps taken if someone was sworn in as president when by the constitution someone else should have been There are rules to unseating the president so I can t imagine you just call do over This would obviously get extremely messy especially if congress and or the real president are of a different party than the person sworn in Would it take an impeachment or would the previous swearing in be annulled and the proper president just get sworn in later It seems like if there s no other new line of succesion and the new president recognizes the error and willingly abdicates the office should pass to the previous cabinet member but would it or would it fall into a limbo of well now there s no president at all so congress appoints one What if we didn t know this about this survivor for a month or two because they were in a coma and by the time that was known a new vice president had been appointed meaning if the president steps down the true survivor wouldn t be in line any longer,US Presidential succesion what if the wrong person is sworn in,0
On Wednesday th September YouTube announced they will update their policy guidelines to remove all misinformative videos about vaccins Since August YouTube has already removed more than million videos for spreading misinformation about Covid During the pandemic social media developed a tendency to control more and more the information and keep the information that coincides with their ideology For exemple Trump is banned from Twitter while T bans from Afghanistan can still post on the platform Back to the main subject Science has always questioned its surroundings to find explanations otherwise Science would never evolved In this case YouTube plays the same role as the Church with Galileo and conspiracy theorists are quite happy with that I think YouTube shouldn t take action about this issue because for exemple people who believe in conspiracy theories see the removal of their videos as a validation of their theories Therefore it has the opposite effect that YouTube intended and conspiracy theorists will just go on other platforms and conspiracy theories will keep spreading In my opinion YouTube should recommend in the next video playing an objective explanation about the topic conspiracy theorist we re looking for I was wondering if it could be an effective way to decrease the spread of misinformation worldwide,How to stop misinformation,0

Ignoring the two parties respective disagreements on a number of social and economic issues why is Mitch McConnell insisting that democrats include a debt ceiling increase in reconciliation instead of on its own I would think anyone with half a brain would see that toying with a sovereign default is risky as hell tacking the debt ceiling to reconciliation makes it almost guaranteed that reconciliation passes so he doesn t win anything What s there to gain,US what s the point in Republicans forcing Democrats to raise the debt limit through reconciliation,0

A lot of liberals say that the conservatives opposition to abortion is really about men controlling women If that s the case I d expect there to be loopholes in anti abortion laws that would permit an abortion if the husband or the woman s father wants it Like if the husband says I don t want my wife to have a baby because we can t afford it or if a father says I don t want my daughter to have a baby because it would dishonor the family In those cases granting the abortion would be in the interests of the man,Do anti abortion policies pushed by conservatives have loopholes concerning the consent of the father,0

I currently live in Missouri and our Republican politicians like to go on these right wing populist screeds example They seem to have this obsession with the government having power or control their rhetoric suggests the Left liberals government pursue acquiring power for the sake of acquiring more power like some kind of cartoon villain Despite this at least rhetorical paranoia they persist in Campaigning for the public to elect them to positions of governmental authority Holding office Exercising the levers of government power Fawning over the most concrete manifestations of governmental power the police and military Attempting to impose their own controlling freedom reducing policies One imagines they perceive a world where government officials are smashing through the doors of everyday citizens late some stormy night strapping them down and injecting some random substance into their bodies cackling maniacally between thunder claps The rest of us see something more like workplace health and safety regulations requiring people handling food to wash their hands or get vaccinated against smallpox or polio Where is this coming from Isn t this the very same government we all vote for to you know enact laws in the interest of the common welfare not some hostile invader bent on exploiting everything they can What motivates this paranoid rhetoric From what I can tell they and or the primarily rural to exurban conservative base they re trying to speak to could be Actually suffering from conditions impacting mental health They sound paranoid because they are paranoid Some of the fringest right wing pundits spout ideas that sound almost schizophrenic Alex Jones being a prominent example Psychodynamic theorists consider frequent use of ego defense mechanisms like projection splitting and idealization grandiosity to be signs of borderline or psychotic level personality integration maturity They have some kind of kink about being dominated not to kink shame and so it s always on their mind the tyrannical government of King George III shoving its big black boot down their throat They only accept the concept of negative liberty and dictates backed by their religious authorities,Wherefrom This Paranoid Style in U S Conservatism,0

Obviously these are two very political Supreme Court decisions Depending on your politics you may consider one to be an untouchable sacred bedrock of our democracy and social fabric and the other is something that should be reversed as soon as possible Putting personal politics aside is there anything specific to these decisions or the mechanics of the cases that make one more or less durable than the other or makes the impact of the decision easier or harder to circumvent,In terms of durability is there a difference between Roe V Wade and Citizens United,0
I m having a difficult time understand the politics of the United States I know that there are many Republicans who idolize Donald Trump and demonize the Democrats But when it comes to those in the liberal side it likewise seems that they would ideally prefer to live in some sort of autocracy An autocracy that silences their opposition removes the minor religious ceremonies from government abolishes the GOP etc In other words when I look at the US I see two fierce camps that believe that the nation should be ruled under a one party state Am I correct in this What kind of nation has people who hate their fellow neighbors Who wish that other parties would be abolished etc This is not a real republic,Do American liberals ideally prefer a stable secular autocracy or an argumentative republic,0

it is actually the unintentional consequences of over sharing of incomplete information by official sources and poor algorithm design meaning it is a systemic accountability problem A few example on what I mean by systemic accountability problem People learn new information at different rates and it takes a significant amount of time for corrections to any information to fully reach the majority of the public With the ivermectin debacle the FDA and CDC had to make public statements to stem the tide of official information sharing months after corrections were made Over sharing information leads to varying degrees of confusion and misinterpretations as the information conflicts with each other It also damages the much needed credibility of the associated institutions exacerbating the production of conspiracy theories and popularity of alternative sources On top of all this left leaning media and Democrat leaders exploit this confusion abd in various ways does misinform people for partisan gain further exacerbating the credibility problem that produces conspiracy theories and popularity of alternative sources The right s demographics mean they do learn new information too slowly but this doesn t make them lesser as the left receives information too quickly and often in incomplete form Our polarization is essentially two sides of the same coin problem The majority of information claimed to be fake news shared by the right was originally from official sources eventually deemed incorrect All our political debates are disproportionately based on incomplete information cherry picked from the pool of academic papers,Why is the go to for information inconsistencies amongst the general public to blame the right for spreading misinformation when,0

My father says California would get consumed by a Mexican cartel in less than a month while Texas would do just fine He also says Texas s debt is a lot less that a big economy doesn t matter when you have so much debt but when you compare the size of California vs Texas economy California s is times that of Texas Texas suddenly isn t so on top of their debt Better than California to be sure but not I paid off a house at twenty eight by being responsible monetary management I argued that companies will leave Texas because why bother staying they go to Texas because it s cheap for an American state no So why the hell would they stay in Texas once it s all alone Same thing with California but I figured neither would do very well He also argues that nobody would leave Texas as compared to California when Texas s political divide is much less intense than California s I personally think that if a state were to secede a lot of people would probably leave just to continue being American but that s just me I would leave my state to avoid the catastrophe that would be my state after secession anyway So generally both new nations would probably be doomed to a significantly decreased quality of life after leaving the USA But which would do better on its own California or Texas And how obvious would the divide be,Who would do better as a separate nation California or Texas,0

Anecdotally I see a lot of posts about some hardcore rightwing masks vaccines are tyranny type characters contracting and dying from covid Unsure if these stories are popular here on reddit because of some dark sense of ironic justice or because most of the people now a days having a fatal encounter with covid are the ones who refuse take precautions against it or as folks here like to say fuck around find out My question If the stats line up with the anecdote and the extreme right wing folks are just straight up shooting themselves in the foot medically and fatally so is their body count going to cause a blue shift in future elections I know a lot of places are neck and neck with the red vs blue voters so even a less than change on just one side of the political aisle could flip county or state so is the difference in right wing covid deaths vs left wing covid deaths close enough to the difference in red vs blue votes in any battleground political zones that a blue outcome could be directly attributed to would be voters who died from covid,With covid being so heavily politicized and precautions against contracting spreading it being made into a partisan divide Is its death toll also disproportionately high on one side of the political aisle and is the number expected to be high enough to flip upcoming election outcomes,0

The swastika symbols are racism and it like other symbols that violate dignity and humanity wants to be banned worldwide because racism that is always wrong and is never right And I really mean never Modern peoples and politicians are asking for and demand that all visible swastika symbols be removed because this symbol offend and hurt several people This means therefore that no symbol that could incite people to racism should be visible in public for example on a street in a park or in a museum This sounds really good to me but there are still people and even an entire religion on this planet that opposes the whole idea and considers it insane Why,We understand that people should be protected from racism and discrimination as it is the job of states but then why do Hindus oppose an international ban on swastikas,0

I have what seems like an unusual amalgamation of political views At least it seams to be rare in the West What should I label myself as amp xB I have nothing against the free market in theory as long as the economy at large serves the greater good of the nation free hospitals free though meritocratic education affordable high quality public transport social housing etc All strategic industries should be under tight government control though I dislike outsiders ethnic and cultural I am against migrants and want to live in an ethnically and culturally homogeneous society I believe that everyone should conform to the basic cultural norms of the society I detest most religions and can t take people who believe in a god in the st century after we have gone to space seriously Most religions are against human nature I believe that any and all sexual perversions are unacceptable and should receive zero tolerance I can t believe I need to say it but homosexuality is a disgusting disorder that shouldn t be discussed in a polite society Transgenderism is a very dangerous self destructive disorder that should elicit a forced hospitalization No feminism or whatever I support healthy families Veganism and the like should NOT be encouraged People should eat meat and stop humanizing animals I am not a fan of democracy let alone of democratic values Democracy is a tool not the end goal itself as it is often depicted It also relies on the intelligence of the voters and considering that the average IQ of a voter is people are stupid and will make stupid decisions At the very least I don t want the supreme leader of the nation to be elected directly by the people since there is nothing more dividing than having to choose who would lead you It is fine when a ruler is elected in a landslide but what if the winning candidate recieves That makes the other half of the population automatically disenfranchised amp xB What am I What should I call myself I usually refer to myself as a SOCIALIST since I seem to support a form of market socialism along the lines of Scandinavia but in the West that word seems to imply the love for migrants along with homosexuals feminists and other ridiculous brands of non conformists that leach of the larger society I have been called a FASCIST before whether out of kindness or as an insult but that doesn t seem to fit my views either From what I have read fascism seems to reject the concept of human nature and I believe that all decisions must be made accounting for the evolutionary psychology and basic instincts of humans Fascism also seems to imply complete obedience to one leader and while I do believe in strong stable leadership at the end of the day the leader should serve the people not the other way round I am not a NAZI either since I don t believe in any racial theory or any form of intrinsic superiority I am a nationalist for my people for no other reason that I happened to be born among them What am I Conservative socialist Patriotic socialist Social fascist Social Nationalist What would be the best way to summarise my views P S I already asked a similar sounding question some time ago so I apologise in advance for that,What are my political views called,0

Yeah but I spoke to and sort of the known head but nobody was sure but now I m sure and I was sure then when I was speaking to him And I knew as soon as I spoke to him And even the introduction I say hello and he screamed something very tough And I then started with him I said listen before we start the longtime conversation and conversations that we re going to have I have to say one thing and I ll never have to say it again to you And here s what I say If you do anything bad to the United States of America if you do anything bad to any of our civilians to any American citizen or if you do anything out of the normal you know they ve been fighting for a thousand years but out of the normal because you ve had your wars and if you do anything out of the normal but anything bad to America or any American citizens I will hit you harder than anybody has ever been hit in world history You will be hit harder than any country and any person has ever been hit in world history And we will start with the exact location and the exact town and it s right here And I believe I repeated the name of his town That will be the first place that we start And I won t be able to speak to you anymore after that and isn t that a very sad thing But that is the story And then he asked me one question and I d rather not repeat that question because it s a very scary question But he asked me one question and I gave him the answer yes And then after it was all done I said OK now I ve said what I m going to say Let s have a conversation And I said we re going to be leaving after years And when we leave you re going to leave us alone and we re going to leave with great dignity and great honor And we are going to take care of this situation We re going to take our time We had a date of May but they missed a couple of conditions We had some very strong conditions Hugh But they missed a couple of conditions I wanted to be out by May I had spoken to him quite a bit before May but we had a condition of May But they missed conditions and so therefore I bombed and we hit them very hard And then we said we will agree to those conditions I said no you ve already agreed to them Don t play games We had them so good They weren t in Kabul You take a look at when they started taking over Afghanistan It s when I left When I left that s when it started they started going wild because they were dealing with another president And I never realized and of course I realized the importance and power of the presidency but I never realized how important the office of the president is until this happened because when I watched what happened over the last week and a half with some horrible stupid decisions that were made number one being allowing our military to leave before the civilians and before we get all of our equipment back billion dollars And not nobody can even comprehend that much equipment Thousands of vehicles thousands you saw the list of vehicles,Is former president Donald Trump mentally ill,0
I understand most of it logically it s kinda dumb that if you have a majority in the senate you can t get a bill passed but is there a rebuttal to the idea that it could very quickly and easily come back to bite Dems in the butt if Republicans gain control of the senate,What s the argument for getting rid of the filibuster,0
Why don t we put a wall up around Afghanistan and some signs saying danger here be dragons just for good measure and leave the Afghanistan people alone and forget about them for a while because it seems like every time a foreign power invades the region it doesn t end well since it seems like the entire region of Afghanistan is horribly cursed like the idea of invading Russia during the winter I mean seriously let them sort themselves out,Why can t we put up a wall around Afghanistan and some signs,0
That is are members of a particular political group making up most of the deaths and will they die in sufficient numbers to change election results I m thinking states like Georgia and Florida for the most part that seem to be or are becoming swing states but maybe even Texas Thanks and have a good night,Is there enough data to know how much Covid deaths will effect elections,0
Amidst the chaos confusion and blame shifting that s been going on the last week or so since the disastrously handled withdrawal of American citizens and Afghan allies there has been recent revelations that members of the Biden Administration or the State Department gave lists of names and identities of people still in Afghanistan that they want out of the country Given that the Taliban is clearly a hostile group that cannot be trusted to value life and given that we ve essentially been at war with them for the last years how does the act of giving literal lists of what amount to targets to the Taliban not amount to outright official treason The formal definition of treason according to the United States Legal code is gt Whoever owing allegiance to the United States levies war against them or adheres to their enemies giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere is guilty of treason and shall suffer death or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States As such a plain text reading of this provision would seem to indicate that whoever prepared and distributed such lists would be giving aid to the enemy given recent events Barely more than a week ago Biden was on the record as saying that a Taliban takeover was impossible and now not even a week later we re behaving on an official level as though they re allies which is absurd to a preposterous degree If Biden was involved on any level with the decision regarding these lists is he not also roped into this as well If formal charges were to be levied how would that actually go and what would the counter argument against them be other than pleading ignorance Legal experts please weigh in,Does the Biden Administration giving lists of American and Afghan allies identities to the Taliban constitute Treason,0
Ccitizen of Ireland here and I can t help but notice that the entire world is in danger thanks to the actions of the POTUS All I keep hearing from the militaries around the world is that these horrific events of recent weeks have not only been foreseeable but they were absolutely forseen So why does Joe Biden still have a job I and many many others were already well aware of his mental decline long before Afghanistan became the highlight of world news so I m worried why it s taking so long to impeach him,Why has Joe Biden not been impeached Are Americans really going to wait and see what he messes up next,0
The Constitution has certain prerequisites for becoming President such as age restrictions nationality and term limitations How are these enforced and at what point is the ineligible candidate challenged Let s say Justin Bieber a year old Canadian decides to run for President Would the other political party challenge him in court as soon as he announces Would all states plus DC refuse him being on the ballot Even if he s not officially on the ballot what if he generates enough popularity that he garners enough write in votes to win or at least sway the election OK I know that may be an extreme rhetorical example but some real life examples where the question could have come up Ted Cruz was born to American parents but he was born in Calgary Wouldn t that have made him ineligible in,How is an ineligible person prevented from becoming US President,0
I keep reading comments like Americans didn t care about Afghanistan since years so the mess left behind won t matter on posts about Biden s dropping approval rating then what was the impetus behind withdrawal in Afghanistan especially since American casualties were not high for a while and the campaign was mostly shifted to an air combat role,The afghan withdrawal,0
Everything is so polar in the US right now but to my understanding pulling out of Afghanistan has been in the works for years Trump had meetings with the Taliban last year Biden follows through with it Like if there was a deadline set what else is he really going to do I don t support Biden but i couldn t really see trump handling the situation any better Trump supporters are coming out of hiding again I read he called the taiban good fighters the other day Its a sad situation during even harder times I feel like the world needs a reset Side question if i had an idea for how the world should run what would be a good community for that,Does all the blame fall on Biden for Afghanistan,0
So I was trying to look up any news outlet pieces on the outcome of Hunter Biden s art auction Not knowing if it was ever concluded I was curious about the timing of the original show and the pronouncements by President Biden about Afghanistan Does anyone have information on the conclusion of the art sale what pieces were sold how much was raised I wonder because the optics are so bad on Afghanistan right now but Biden insists on making life hard on his admin staff by refusing to budge In my mind could he be falling on his own sword for the simple reason of protecting his child Being a father of boys I completely understand the innate reflex to protect your children but if that s what is driving this politically suicidal stance on the Afghanistan withdrawl at the expense of America s position internationally and amongst our allies that s criminal I m not conspiracy mongering here but am just genuinely curious Can any one shed light on the timing and help me walk back from the ledge Please keep it a civil discourse here,Afghanistan and Hunter Biden s art auction,0
I read this book The Ethical Ideals of Jesus in a Changing World although I m not Christian it was probably one of the best books I ve ever read I think I read the book must ve been years ago Anyway I asked before after reading the book what the statement Democracy imprisoned in parochial states degenerates into nationalism means I had just about of confused commenters So now I ask again after looking back on my notes I still have no idea what this statement means,Can someone please tell me what this statement means in simpler terms,0
I m looking for a website that rates Politicians a on how loyal they are to their party Their rating would be based on what Legislation they ve voted on what laws they back their stance on major policies Kinda like rotten tomato but for politicians Does such a thing exist I imagine it would If there are more than one I d love all that are creditable or reasonable Essentially I don t want bias to influence their ratings b c their track record should speak for itself,Political Rotten Tomato,0

I ain t American The US Union can t force the states to do lots of things and American states have lots of liberties They all need to democracies they all need to be republics and so on I was reading that counties in the state of Indiana have restricted the deployment of renewables due to a backlash from the citizens And the state of Indiana house is studying a law that would forbidden the counties to pass these laws As far my understanding goes and I know that it could be a good case for the US Supreme Court but most certainly a law like this would be unlawful by the US Congress Most certainly the states have the right to restrict the deployment of renewables Anyway without digging deep in the discussion about renewables my question is is there a state that is so federalist that a law like Indiana s would also be unlawful Is there a state where counties have no rights whatsoever and are just administrative divisions like unitaries states in Europe like Spain I would probably guess that California gives its counties more liberties than Maryland But it s just a guess To wrap up could you give me a sense of the level of federalism there are in different American states,Are US States homogeneous in the way they give their counties liberties,0
They already knew we were going to pull out Why weren t we moving people out of the country for the last months We were trying to get people out then we sent in to get the out wtf is going on,How did the Afghanistan withdrawal go this horribly,0
I ve seen a meme that basically has this opinion Most likely because of the conflict of Afghanistan My opinion is that civilian discussion is important for multiple reasons gt The point of civilian control is to make security subordinate to the larger purposes of a nation rather than the other way around The purpose of the military is to defend society not to define it gt The danger of granting military leaders full autonomy or sovereignty is that they may ignore or supplant the democratic decision making process and use physical force or the threat of physical force to achieve their preferred outcomes in the worst cases this may lead to a coup or military dictatorship gt Military personnel because of the nature of their job are much more willing to use force to settle disputes than civilians because they are trained military personnel that specialize strictly in warfare The military is authoritative and hierarchical rarely allowing discussion and prohibiting dissention Basically limiting the discussion and outright dismissing civilians keeps them uneducated and without opinions and talking about political war policies can lead to blind faith in the military Which isn t good Opinions What are your thoughts,What is your opinion on only people who served in the military having a valid opinion on political warfare,0
The idea would be capitalism but the government would take of the money and goods from a dead person s estate and distribute it equally to the population or keep all of it but significant lower taxation,Is there a ideology for capitalism but anti inheritance,0
So the US and Taliban made an agreement back in February which means that the negotiations must ve started under the Trump administration The pull out and take over of Kabul has been chaotic but not violent And Biden is saying that the US troops will remain to help evacuate all the tens of thousands of US allies citizens I suspect also protecting some of the people who worked with the US over the last two decades Additionally I know that Blinken has no problem working with any sort of fundamentalist extremist salafis in Syria most famously also his plans in Libya etc Iran has known the Taliban would take control for years they ve been preparing for that inevitability since at least the Obama administration which again makes me think of Blinken since he was integral in the Iran deal I can t imagine he is not in conversation with Tehran about all this now And of course the US did work with the Taliban in the s I remember when they came to Houston to make a deal with Unocal they were wined and dined by Kissinger even amp xB Alright so it seems to me that all that s happening is the US has decided that it s going to work with the Taliban again Leave a few troops or private contractors more likely behind so that the worst of a possible resulting civil war will not destabilize business interests there then negotiate some sort of new supportive relationship with the Taliban and then cast eyes up to Uzbekistan and Kazak energy markets right Is this nuts Seems like everyone freaking out about collapse and chaos are still stuck in some weird way of thinking that the US was ever trying to spread democracy or do nation building etc Seems especially a bizarre take given what we know about US policy in Afghanistan in the first place the longest and most expensive CIA project ever was Operation Cyclone so at the bare minimum we have to start from a place that US foreign policy will arm support salafists and terrorists to protect its economic interests and global hegemony From there makes sense that the withdrawal from Afghanistan could simply be deciding to support the people they were ostensibly fighting,possible afghan strategy,0
I imagine this scenario Gavin Newsom believes he s going to lose so he resigns to have a Democratic Lt Governor replace him instead of the potential recall second choice So what happens then The recall question on the ballot Something like Shall Gavin Newsom be recalled removed from office no longer makes any sense now that he resigned Does the recall election still happen Or does the election get canceled and supporters of recall need to gather signatures to recall the Lt Governor instead,What happens if Gavin Newsom resigns before the September th recall election Will the election be canceled,0
I keep reading that Pakistan has been supporting the Taliban Apparently they feel safer with a religiously fundamentalist government in Afghanistan than with a nationalistic government But nevertheless it seems like the Taliban is too extreme and not something one would want on their borders Pakistan already has a lot of refugees from Afghanistan and is expecting more Some of the instability and fundamentalism could also spread to Pakistan,Why isn t Pakistan afraid of the Taliban,0
I ve heard pakman vaush and destiny disagree with the horseshoe theory But far left communists don t like corporation run countries and want an egalitarian society Facist far right wants every corporation and business to uphold nationalistic values and do everything for the people and the country it resides in Obviously they re are caveats and different methods of getting to their goal But isn t that the point of horseshoe theory Despite being much different they want the same thing,If the far left and the far right are anti capitalism why do so many liberal political commentators say horseshoe theory is wrong,0
Unlike other Americans my labor isn t valuable enough to provide for my family by working only days I work the entire week to provide for my family Limiting that income ain t right Overtime legislation and healthcare other benefits raises the price of my labor beyond what is affordable to my employer so I have to seek another employer That ain t right either It s gonna take me another several years to afford schooling And then another several years to work through school and then another several years to become skilled enough to have valuable labor in the capitalist market I m an American I can t afford to raise the price of my labor to that of a European My employer says that s too expensive for him cause he wants more profit,A congressman is introducing day workweek legislation How does that help undervalued Americans like me,0
I feel for any of those who are suffering since troop withdrawal I really do But is there a point of showing videos of murders and deaths and suffering of people over there when there is absolutely nothing we average reddit users can even do about it I feel those videos are shared for wanting to send American troops BACK in or morbid curiosity,Anybody see all the news about Afghanis right now and think the underlying context is to send troops back in,0
The main idea behind school choice seems to be that you can choose how you want to educate your kids and your tax dollars follow your kid wherever you send them public school charter school private school etc Does that mean if you pay K in property taxes that you could get a substantial chunk of that back by homeschooling your own kids,Does School Choice legislation allow parents to get thousands of dollars in property taxes back if they choose to homeschool their own kids,0

I m looking for something more that just that s the Republican way rhetoric The decision to do so and the timing were both clearly decided and communicated by Trump Biden just agreed and followed through What are the specific points being criticized If this has been posted already please point me in that direction and I ll take this one down I looked but it s not easy to search for something like that on this sub,Why are so many GOP leaders criticizing Biden for the withdraw from Aghanistan,0
If it s out there I d really like to find an organized list of the United States history in Afghanistan sorted by leadership at the time Would also be huge bonus if that could be timelined with other nations as well I m not worried about neutrality and would prefer it wasn t sugar coated but just as long as it s factual I m seeing threads that keep jumping back to actions that happened with every President and jump even earlier For example Reagan giving arms to Mujahideen that became the Taliban feels like important context if I want to learn from a very big picture or how actions cascade to new generations,Does anyone have a well researched list of each US leader s and maybe even all world leader s actions role in Afghanistan,0
If there is one thing I noticed socialists LOVE to tell people how better things can be They LOVE to tell people they can be paid more at their job that evil landlords shouldn t exist and that healthcare shouldn t be for profit But that s all they do all talk Public housing takes years to get into meanwhile people are making their landlord richer because they don t have public housing Which the socialist say is bad yet they don t have enough money to build AND maintain more public housing Socialists LOVE Unions because supposedly worker wages are higher yet to this day they are unable to outfund capitalists on union related information Companies like Amazon and Walmart have A DEPARTMENT they spend money on which would otherwise go to CEO AND SHAREHOLDER PROFITS to inform people unions are bad socialists have no such spending and their recruitment tactics are easily foiled by anti union propaganda And last of all socialist love spouting that own the means of production bs yet they haven t set up any useful means of production anywhere Socialists have no mines refinement factories or widget factories Socialists in my area do not have any operations that produce anything of value Not a cafeteria not an auto repair shop not a laundromat or any of the other services that workers use to get through their day to day drudgery,When are the socialists gonna put THEIR MONEY where their mouth is,0
Legitimate and serious question I don t see people practicing masks and safe distances Are the Afghans vaccinated Would the Afghan government request vaccines from the US I genuinely don t know anything about Afghanistan other than all those I see in the news Haven t been and don t have the financials to travel there and check for myself,Where s Covid in Afghanistan,0
We all saw videos of the airport being overrun and Afghanis hanging off the C but my question free from blaming a y parties and unknowing of the circumstances on the ground could we have done anything differently,Was a better withdrawal possible I Afghanistan,0
I read a tweet today where the person writing used the example of Afghanistan to show how the subaltern cannot build progressive nations In the case of India this person argues that because there was an elitist vision at the top at the time of nation building that modern and progressive society in India was made possible While I agree to a certain extent that yes India owes significantly to the liberal minds that built that independent nation state idk how I feel about the association of progressiveness to elitism From what I understand the subaltern would might take into consideration the multitudes of the society Afghanistan is not the right example for it It s a sheer case of extremism What do others think,Can the subalterns not build a progressive nation,0
It seems like of people support Biden s decision to withdraw from Afghanistan However it seems to me that the withdrawal and evacuation of non military personnel and asylum seekers was botched Surely the administration knew there was a scenario where the Taliban would take over within days of the military leaving Are strategic decisions not made to address the worst possible scenario Why were ambassadors foreign service journalists NGOs and Afghan staff not evacuated in the days prior to the military withdrawal,Why was the withdrawal from Afghanistan done without a non military evacuation beforehand,0
Just curious That s a trending topic right now,Why is Zabihulla allowed on Twitter but not Trump,0
I have friends that work in government buildings or even as security detail for particularly high ranked government officials Are their lives now in danger Should they be seriously considering seeking asylum somewhere Does working for Western supported government make them eligible for that or is it just reserved for Interpreters etc Should they at the least assume that funding for payroll or any way to keep employment is wishful thinking at this time Possibly dumb questions but I ve never had a close personal interest during the fall of a government before so I really don t know how things go,What happens to Afghan government employees now,0
What are a list of things he has accomplished that he said he would during his campaign,What campaign promises has Biden delivered on so far,0
I know Black lives Matter as an organization only really started in the early s But that was still several years of campaigning and being a group Overall when I type it in I see that its always a justification or defense of Obama Rarely do I see articles that criticize Obama in some extent for not doing enough for what would be modern day civil rights activists When I read some of the articles they only serve as empty platitudes which emphasize how Obama was all words but no actions Now this isn t a defense against Trump or even Biden Both men yes also Biden webp du amp sqp CIQYgG amp rs AOnCLDfIVbiMWGflNOvgeAGalA have a history of supporting racist policies that harm or push back against what the African American community advocates and pursue policies that overall are harmful to minorities Biden may give some semblance of progress but only when he is forced to And this isn t a defense against Black Lives Matter either The movement itself has proven to very hostile to Asian s as a whole which I find reeks of hypocrisy Overall I detest the group for this very reason as I feel this quote basically summarizes my feelings gt Do or don t There is no otherwise If those are you values then you live them whole heartingly every day If they are not then don t say so Still my point stands Why has Black Lives Matter been so silent on Obama,Why didn t Black Lives Matter Criticize Obama as heavily as they criticized Trump or even Biden,0
According to this article the Taliban made million dollars from mineral extraction It reminded me of this video from Caspian Report which is a YouTube channel on geopolitics There are lots of mineral deposits in Afghanistan mostly in the north and east of the country This is a map from that shows Taliban territory back then html Most of the country was still in government control including the lucrative mining areas So how did the Taliban wrest control of these areas Why didn t the Afghan government defend them more vigorously,How did the Taliban get a hold of Afghanistan s mineral wealth,0
Keep saying stories about us evacuating people then seeing commenters talking about how many translators etc we re leaving out to dry Has a real effort been made to get people out or did we really just drop the ball on a lot of people in our corner,Did the US evacuate its allies in aghanistan or not and to what degree,0
Overall it seems that almost all millennials lean liberal and most of Gen z is not a fan of the Republicans either so in the s and s will they weaken causing the democrats to have more power,Will the Republicans be weakened in the s and s due to their lack of power among young people,0
Republicans are pretending to care about the well being of Afghan citizens now that it provides an excuse to slam Biden for pulling out troops and cutting off our easy and illegal access to oil and other resources in the region To be pro soldier from a leftist perspective means keeping them out of war if we can help it but just like with Vietnam it appears that we re leaving people to be subject to suffering by just pulling out of the country America probably never had a vested interest is ridding the world of the Taliban and installing democracy as long as they had easy access to resources so maybe it s for the best that they end the charade If there s anything I m missing please let me know,What are we to make of Afghanistan It feels like there wasn t a right answer,0
The news on this is confusing Did we actually just quit the war,Has the US completely withdrawn from Afghanistan,0

It was Trump right I m not asking to criticize any president I m genuinely very curious,Who initiated the removal of U S troops from Afghanistan,0
I m listening to The Whisperers by Orlando Figes and he quotes Lazar Kaganovich on his justification of the Great Terror in interviews in the s gt The leadership had realized a war was approaching and that the country needed to protect itself by draining the swamp boloto That is by destroying unreliables and waverers Was the call by Donald Trump s campaign to drain the swamp a clever double entendre that the public and the party hardliners would interpret differently It seems so since the administration did manage to oust so many and install people recognized as loyal to the President,Was Drain the Swamp Borrowed from Russia,0
Could this be a reason why the US has its current system I dont know much about these things but i was wondering if that could impact the process I would imagine that a smaller European country would have less trouble implementing that system Or maybe its possible that this has absolutely no effect on anything,Does the size of the USA area and population have any effect on the implementation of universal healthcare,0

Apologies if this is the wrong place to ask I grew up liberal and am surrounded by liberal viewpoints but every once in a while I get exposed to conservative viewpoints straight from the mouth as a friend s sibling likes to listen to Ben Shapiro and Matt Walsh As I understand it many people are against mask mandates because they don t want to live in fear and feel that a mask mandate impinges on their freedom However I would presume if you asked a conservative if those statements come to mind when considering the requirement to have headlights while driving the requirement to have a driver s license while driving the requirement to stop at red lights the illegality of drunk driving the stupidity and illegality of pulling a gun on a police officer unprovoked and out of the blue the illegality of punching a random stranger on the street the illegality of pouring sewage on a random stranger on the street then they would not believe these government safety measures to be living in fear nor impinging on their freedom What s the difference From a liberal point of view masks are far less intrusive and more life saving than the majority of the above bullet points Is that solely where the contention lies Conservatives simply subjectively find it more intrusive and don t find any science related to the life saving effects of masks credible Or is there some other difference I m missing,What distinguishes mask mandates from other government based safety measures,0

Where have the compassionate Republicans like Fred Rogers gone who recognize the intrinsic value of every individual regardless of class or race and consider everyone s personal struggles legitimate He spent considerable time with everyone he encountered that they deserve to be treated kindly and with equity He showed that there are always heroes within chaos and that we can all be heroes He was capable of optimism even in the worst of times while being realistic about the human aspects of cause and effect He did all of this outside of the realm of personal politics and without invoking political rhetoric He was actually vilified by various talking heads on Fox News later in his life but he had measurably positive effects on the development of every child invested in his show What happened Where have compassionate conservatives like him gone,Today I learned that Fred Rogers of Mister Rogers Neighborhood was a lifelong Republican Where have the compassionate Republicans like him gone,0

I just read an article where biden is extending loan payments in the article it mentioned Biden said he wants congress to forgive k in student debt per person And yes this is good but the article also mentioned congress is focused on the infrastructure bill so they arent looking into student debt I think an infrastructure bill is good but I feel like we should be spending our time on everything the pandemic messed up Student loans Evictions job losses and who knows what else Before this pandemic our focus was on climate change and our future I at the time this bill might have been helpful regarding charging stations and transportation But now we have half a country who doesn t want to get vac despite many efforts including incentives People are still dying and struggling due to the pandemic but trillion in something that wasn t effected is our focus There is trillion in debt right now God knows how much rent and payments is owed I think right now would be a good time to raise the minimum wage And if my memory doesnt fail me nurses are being underpaid and apparently we dont have a universal government backed EMS Wouldn t the money be better spent fixing what started,Why would the government make infrastructure a priority or everything the pandemic caused,0

I m in the middle of Children of Dune by Frank Herbert The title is actually on the outside of the box set and only books in I see so many parallels The quote below is a chapter opening that summed up a political position I have gt In all major socializing forces you will find an underlying movement to gain and maintain power through the use of words From witch doctor to priest to bureaucrat it is all the same A governed populace must be conditioned to accept power words as actual things to confuse the symbolized system with the tangible universe In the maintenance of such a power structure certain symbols are kept out of the reach of common understanding symbols such as those dealing with economic manipulation or those which define the local interpretation of sanity Symbol secrecy of this form leads to the development of fragmented sub languages each being a signal that its users are accumulating some form of power With this insight into a power process our Imperial Security Force must be ever alert to the formation of sub languages LECTURE TO THE ARRAKEEN WAR COLLEGE BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN gt Sub languages Dialects Lingo Languages change with distance and time whether that is across a country or up a ladder As our language has changed so has the language of bureaucracy If someone is not a student of law or political science then much or the terminology that dictates their life may go right over their head Not that they would have time to sift through laws and citations and addendums and footnotes The Covid Relief Bill was over pages of government jargon that no one read but it was put into action regardless I understand that some legislation just isn t simple but why does everything have to be so damned complicated,Dune More relevant than when it was published,0

If you ve spent any significant amount of time talking to people on different platforms about politics chances are you ll hear a lot of definitions of the word liberal For example most people you talk to on Facebook or in the real world might say that a liberal is a far left Democrat voter with dyed hair and piercings and a sickle and hammer tattoo who talks about needing a safe space from microagressions but if you ask someone on Reddit or Twitter the answer might sound more like a billionaire year old politician who bombs poor people in third world countries to get their oil and pumps toxic waste directly into the mouths of endangered whales Of course these are caricatures of the two most extreme definitions but you get the point Looking up the definition of liberal gives a broad definition that talks about supporting equality before the law and freedom something which no normal person would be opposed to Strangely however very few people that know about politics would ever call themselves a liberal Liberal almost always carries this negative meaning with it So my question to r askpolitics is from the point of view to an average person in the st century in your own words what is your practical definition of a liberal What does the average liberal look like Are many average citizens liberals or is that mostly the ruling class Who are good modern examples of liberals Is Bernie Sanders a liberal or perhaps Joe Biden or Hillary Clinton or even Donald Trump,What does the word liberal mean to you,0
A controversial question but let s examine the fact that every territory has its advantages and disadvantages its assets and liabilities There are many people who say that the island is more of liability even though it offers great spots for tourism It also has the benefit of providing the US with better flexibility in the Caribbean for military affairs But there are also the Virgin Islands which is in the Caribbean as well and let s not forget how the Florida Keys is also a great asset for the federal government So what exactly is Puerto Rico providing the US A few years ago Trump made a proposal to the Kingdom of Denmark to purchase the territory of Greenland This was of course so the US can have better access to the arctic and when we look back in the days of McKinley we saw how the Pacific Islands played an immense role in establishing trade relations with Asia But Puerto Rico seems like an anomaly What exactly is the US gaining from it and is it worth it,What does the US gain from controlling Puerto Rico,0

I m looking for perspectives of left leaning or leftist people who are pro gun I have a theory that the reason why America has so much gun violence compared to other countries that permit them is because of our culture Americans consider having a gun a virtue that makes you a true patriot You see people toting guns in their social media pictures This radical pro gun culture feeds a psychosis in some individuals In other countries guns are taboo even if you re allowed to own one They re treated as a tool not a badge of honor I believe the differences in culture are why America has the most gun violence out of any pro gun countries,How can we reform gun control laws in the U S without violating the nd Amendment,0
When he asks for donations Donald Trump says it s to save America protect the integrity of elections etc But he doesn t have to justify where the money is going I m sure he would get just as much money from his followers if he just said honestly that he wanted the money for himself to fight the legal and media scrutiny he and his company face after his presidency etc Why does he need to still appeal to American patriotism while so many of his followers seem to hold Donald Trump the personality above the idea of America,If Donald Trump is so beloved by his followers why does he still feel like he has to promise to them that their donations will benefit the country Why can t he just ask for money for himself,0

A lot of articles I see about the misinformation concerning Covid vaccines focus on how it is disseminated on social media platforms and via influencers But I am wondering who benefits politically from making people more skeptical about vaccines and how does it benefit one party or another I live in the USA where there is much more vax skepticism on the Republican side than Democrat so how do the Republicans benefit from this Is it simply a way to rally the base around a sensitive topic and create another culture war for elections or is there a more complex way to look at it,Who benefits from Covid vaccine misinfo,0

My employer listed of number of new hires to replace those who have left the company and they re all either interns or have recently graduated This jobs were formerly occupied by highly skilled software development and data science workers Reflecting on it this seems logical for a business given that they re more likely to be willing to work from the office which they just set a return date for and they ll likely have less responsibilities at home However for us older folk this looks like a new age discrimination trend that is likely to continue in this post COVID world Has there been any legislation to address this,Has there been any legislation discussed to address the post COVID age discrimination trend that s beginning,0

I am from Canada we have to show ID to vote get into bars and buy alcohol I don t understand why it could be considered racist to show you are of age to vote and you are from the country you say you are voting in I don t understand the argument that minorities can t afford ID does that mean minorities can t afford to purchase alcohol too I guess in some extreme cases yes some people are that poor I understand but is the wealth disparity that bad that people can t afford to buy alcohol if they are in a certain poverty line Usually when I go to America food and alcohol is cheaper there,As a Canadian I am really confused as to why the Dems are calling Voter ID Laws racist,0

Alright so I m studying UK politics at the moment and it doesn t take much to see that the left wing and especially the Labour Party are victims to some of the most downsides in a long time The Conservatives currently holds a comfortable majority and the opinion polls are not saying that the Conservatives are looking any likely to avoid gettting most seats in the next election as well But polls now are different than from years when the next election arrives and so I have wondered how far parties will go stop another Tory government So I made a scenario The next election gives you this Conservatives Labour Party SNP Liberal Democrats Sinn F in Greens Plaid Cymru Democratic Unionist Party Alliance Party Social Democratic and Labour Party Here Labour Party needs seats to form a majority and could get from SNP from Liberal Democrats from Sinn F in from Greens and from Plaid Cymru leading them to seats Now the thing is I am aware that the UK is not used to coalitions Therefore I wanted to hear whether you think that there is any possibility that a coalition suddenly includes parties And if there are then some issues might erupt looking into some of the parties For SNP I get the idea that they don t like Labour and it s reasonable to think that the SNP would tell both Conservatives and Labour that they needed to promise a refrendum to gain their seats So what if the Conservatives are quicker to announce that they will giving such a promise would the SNP then hesitate and wait for Labour to give them the same opportunity or just take the Conservatives offer For Liberal Democrats even though they are probably centre left would they really prefer supporting Labour instead of Conservatives if it meant they would be of powerful parties instead of of For Sinn F in wikipedia lists them as Abstentionist which I don t know what mean For Greens I guess they would love their chance For Plaid Cymru I wouldn t think they would see much downside of it amp xB So my question is how long would the other parties go to stop another Conservative Government,If Labour SNP Liberal Democrats Greens Plaid Cymru and Sinn F in could form a majority after the next election would they do it,0

With the recent story about Gen Mike Milley and other high ranking military members putting in place a plan to defy orders and resign their posts if Trump was indeed going to go through a coup I m wondering what would resigning actually do To me it seems like resigning would just give the President the ability to fill those posts with the first yes man in an acting position and continue on with a coup As the JSC play more of an advisory role to the President would his Cabinet resigning have more an effect than the JSC resigning,What would the resignations of the Joint Chiefs of Staff or a President s Cabinet actually accomplish,0
I m asking how much a presidential candidate s wife effects overall voter opinions and their decision making process during an election I was reading that many voters strongly disliked Teresa Heinz Kerry during the election and that it negatively effected Kerry s voter turnout as a result On the other hand Melania Trump wasn t exactly a traditional First Lady yet Trump s numbers seem to have been unaffected by this in although his campaign was more than a bit of an anomaly as far as federal elections go I also read in more than a few articles that without Michelle Obama at his side Barack s chances of winning the election would ve been severely hindered One writer even said that Obama would ve never gotten close to the White House without Michelle What are your thoughts on this factor in voter opinions the character and disposition of the potential First Lady Thanks for any answers,How much do voters take into consideration a candidate s wife during presidential elections,0

I literally just got interested in politics and I have done moderate research about different political ideologies but I want to know what ideology fits the description I have been thinking and if it s a good one Upperclass citizens Millionaires Billionaires Owners of major corporations and brands Rich people in general should be taxed the most while still being rich It is illegal for major corporations and brands to grow and prosper at the expense of others especially Indigenous people or people from other countries It is also illegal for those major corporations and brands to exploit their workers and or the working class in general Healthcare and education are not free but are cheaper depending on each citizen s income Major corporations and brands are required for their products to be harmless to the ecosystem like deforestation polluting water etc The government should listen to its citizens and should implement what they are protesting for if it can help the country to develop and progress and are allowed to refuse if some of the citizens will protest anything that may cause harm to the country Again I am new to this but I am willing to learn So yeah is there an ideology that is exactly or similar to what I described If so is it a great ideology,What s a political ideology that is exactly or similar to what I will describe And is it a great ideology,0

I m now and pursuing a law degree with the hope that I can run for political office at some point I have a level head on my shoulders and live a straight edge and scandal free lifestyle However up until a few years ago I was quite the partygoer Casual sex drugs drinking social media posts containing photos of me at parties humorous status updates now deleted etc were the norm for me in my teenage years What is the likelihood that this will come back to bite me in the ass if I run for office in the future I don t have an arrest record but like I said there are photos of me attending parties in high school and otherwise engaging in what could be considered scandalous activities How much of a threat are these records to my career if I do choose to pursue one in public office Is it guaranteed that this will all be uncovered or can I sleep peacefully at night knowing it s not something to be worried about I m concerned about opposition research digging through my personal history interviewing past lovers and acquaintances of mine things of that nature,If I run for political office what is the likelihood that antics from my teenage years will be uncovered and used against me,0
I don t know where else to ask this because the AskHistorians subreddit doesn t like to cover politically charged subjects topics less than years old After the U S and France pulled out of Vietnam the south fell to the north I m curious if the country is faring well now Is Vietnam similar to China in which its citizens are happy even if their government is severely flawed and restrictive in areas Vietnam doesn t seem to be talked about much in modern politics and when it is it s in reference to the anti war movement telling Western forces to pull out But if the country is faring worse now how does the anti war crowd feel about that Do they blame it on the U S for destabilizing the country Do they still feel the ends wouldn t have justified the means Is there a lesson learned here that can be applied to the Afghanistan situation I ve heard about human rights violations in modern Vietnam similar to the Uyghur situation in China To me it seems the position that conservatives would take is that pulling out of Afghanistan would cause it to fall under rule of the Taliban and keep the country in a direction away from freedom,How is Vietnam faring under communist rule Is there a lesson to be learned from the anti Vietnam war movement that can be applied to the anti Afghan war movement,0
From what I can find he actually mused about the government writ large being revisited and revised every years with a voting age of He was suggesting that at you would no longer be in touch with the majority of the electorate The timelines I don t really care about but what do people say about trying to write legislation around say the internet based on a document written with a quill by candlelight Or maybe why amend the constitution instead of revising it Are politicians just not willing to risk sounding anti constitution,What is the argument against revising the constitution every years as Jefferson recommended to Hamilton,0

There are popular threads for Marxism or Socialism but no large ones specifically for Nationalism Immigrantation is obviously a big deal to many people it s precisely immigration rhetoric that got Donald Trump elected in It seems that nobody is ever really given a vote on key issues such as how many immigrants should be allowed in every year I feel that a nation belongs to the current citizens and not to the new arrivals You can argue that this isn t the case for the United States but I don t know how you can argue this for Europe It seems the people in power today really hate any form of Nationalism and want Globalism What do you guys think,Why are there no popular Nationalism threads on Reddit,0

Politics seems like a very complicated subject and one that s often misunderstood from what I ve seen Lots of news outlets are very biased to one side of the political spectrum politicians just throw out political buzzwords all will nilly like communism and so on and so forth which brings me to my question How should one go about politics What should they do to be more enlightened on the topic and how should they consume political media when it s often prone to be very skewed Should one keep a track record on certain politicians so as to see a pattern of some kind I m more so asking this personally I do know that learning certain terms are really essential as people misuse them all the time like I mentioned communism being associated to socialism I simply just do not know where to start If anyone has any book recommendations or any guidance on where to start it d be great I m just lost on politics as it s a pretty broad topic in general,To a beginner what steps should one take to understand politics,0
Context marxist here IDK maybe people in America writing the narrative are referring to something different when using the terms culture war or cultural war but to me a cultural conflict is in place when social phenomena normalized by culture are being questioned to a point where firm advocates of that culture are actively defending it Mainstream western cultures note the plural use of the term please are often problematic normalizers of very opressive things like racism sexism classism neoliberal economy aporaphobia LGBTIQ discrimination and so the list goes on So yeah you bet I m against a culture that does that kind of stuff That doesn t mean I can t enjoy a game of my national sports team or celebrate christmas with my family to put a few examples of something of my culture that I do like Cultures aren t like membership clubs no one gets to decide what anyone else can or cannot do with it No one owns a culture let alone be entitled to dictate how people under it are supposed to behave unless you re screwing people over but I shouldn t be surprised to see that being a hard concept for many westerners to wrap their heads around because prioritizing ownership over human rights or dignity is a such western thing to do So if the aforementioned describes what the right calls culture wars then take it from a commie hell yeah culture wars are real and I m in the front lines I believe the rest left should do the dame,Why do people discuss the existence of culture wars,0
Hi I m currently working in advance of a municipal level political campaign in a small level one and am running into trouble trying to calculate vote totals There s problems currently It s a nonpartisan election meaning no primary everyone runs in the general so there can be anywhere between people running for a single spot Most online trainings say to shoot for presuming a person race but last cycle this office had people running and the winner only took of the vote Many of those people running only announced a couple months before the election Is there a standard way of prepping my candidate as to what the vote goal should be in this environment An equally big issue this race was originally in a city that had city wide races for this position until at which point they broke the city into districts for each locality to vote for their elected official This means I ll only have s vote data so I m uncertain how much good that ll do me Idk if this is even the right subreddit but this is political so I figure someone here might have some knowledge on this,How does one calculate a vote goal in a multi person election Also what do you do if there s redistricting,0
Been watching Second Thought recently probably why I feel this way duhr and man I just want to blow it all up I m a year old male with no hope of buying a home in the near future and the people who ve been elected to represent my country and my people only give a crap about their wallet How is everyone not violently ill to their stomach all the time Or are they and they re just really good at hiding it Honestly hearing news every day makes me want to blow my brains out and if things get worse I just might,Do any of you just feel absolutely sick to your stomach when it comes to the state of US politics,0
For this I m using the US currency rates for a theoretical situation The minimum cost of living in the US is roughly k a year so unless you re in the top the government pays you or k which is enough for you to barely survive but not enough to support a family or have luxuries like internet or the money to be able to get luxury food or buy shit which promotes jobs and work So while work is not compulsory it is a necessity It helps the bottom not starve to death while letting them have opportunities for themselves Like a mix between capitalism and communism taxes are ofcourse present but progressive and don t take literally all you make The money here comes from taxes like in capitalism everything is taxed say you get payed k a part of that is gonna be taxed One problem that would come up here is that smaller countries wouldn t be able to have that much efficiency with the system since purchases would be low and they wouldn t be able to generate enough funds in taxes Thus the system would work better internationally so instead of for example take country A which has people So the government is paying k to the citizens each year but it isn t able to make the k back due to the lack of income being generated in the country The average American made almost k a year in now to do some math total income of all residents total income what the government is paying total income after tax total income after tax divided by citizens k So the money needed will be payed back and the citizen is paying an tax they ll ofc have to pay more than that because the government needs money to build roads and provide for the citizens a n d t o s e c r e t l y s p e n d o n l u x u r i e s This would obviously have a lot more complications in actual countries Hence I propose instead of a country based system a continent based system While each country is ruled and regulated The money comes from a continental government The system is not perfect it does have flaws but there is not and will never be a system that will have flaws I simply propose an idea better than capitalism and communism While flawed it is less flawed than the existing systems This will give people more confidence in trying different ways of making money starting their own business or something because they know that even if it fails they ll still have money to afford the basic needs in our society you can t just open your restaurant for example because in case it fails you ll be left without income and quite possibly with debt so with the system I suggest people would always have a feeling of stability knowing that they ll be always able to afford the necessary things Sources text Living Expenses and entertainment expenses as well,Thoughts on this system I m working on,0
I don t understand this divide in American politics It seems absolutely arbitrary with the ideas pertaining to either of the apparently opposing groups having no relation to each other I am an atheist and dislike religion to say the least religion after we have flown to space seriously I despise feminism and homosexuality I support family values I dislike immigrants and don t feel comfortable surrounded by people of other ethnic racial backgrounds in daily life I want to live in a homogeneous society I support the progressive tax free education and healthcare Where would I fit on the American political spectrum Which party would I vote for It seems that I am equally far from both the Republicans and Democrats Please Don t delete my question I just want an answer It was already deleted by subreddits for arbitrary reasons,Am I right wing or left wing,0
It s often said that the UK government is based on a separation of powers akin to what we see in the US But this is misleading because the Government as well as parliament has the ability to legislate Moreover the Government does not have executive power the house or commons and house or lords have to agree to a law before it s passed With that out of the way how much power does the government really have then given a it can t execute laws on its own it has to get a majority decision in parliament b the parliament itself can propose laws independent of the government c the government s decisions are constantly under scrutiny by parliament,How much autonomy does the UK government particularly the prime minster really have,0

I engage in a great deal of politics on a daily basis and as a broad generalization I have noticed that Democratic political viewpoints tend to center around empathy while Republican political viewpoints tend to center around self interest Weaponizing self interests tends to be an easy process using fear to convince people their self interests are being threatened and getting them to respond with immediacy and intensity to any problem that arises Empathizing with people allows an individual to build and advance a community but tends to marginalize the personal action and restrict the individual from advancement within the community How could empathic people weaponize empathy so that building a community also benefits individuals as a personal goal How can people as empaths convince those that are solely self interested that benefiting the whole also benefits them as individuals,How to weaponize empathy in a capitalist society,0

Historically this has not been the case as was seen in the th century with the rise of Fascism in the West and the rise of Communism in the East While both were products of a wide array of nation specific problems each can be attributed to economic and or political turmoil So historically one would say polarization is a product of turmoil not prosperity However I lose this questions for two reasons There are effectively two sects of polarized political movements that appear to be supported by large swaths of the populous at least in the US Historically this is not common place Rampant misinformation in the media that is not caused by the state In the past misinformation tended to be as a result of government meddling Today misinformation is consumed because there is an economic incentive for businesses to create propagate it Therefore I am curious whether modern hyper polarization is a result of prosperity there is no common or overriding enemy so we make ones of each other The underlying assumptions to the question of course are that prosperity forces a disconnect between people and reality and that reality is fundamentally more moderate or requires more moderate behavior,Is political polarization a product of prosperity,0

This isn t meant to be a straight forward question This is more of a thought experiment born out of the Scott Cawthon drama Let s say we have an individual who has money on the side and they want to donate to of the given politicians a communist who is for homosexuality or a capitalist who is against homosexuality Of course our individual in question will be pro homosexual and pro capitalist They really want to encourage pro homosexual but knows the dangers of communism or at least in their mind the dangers of com are greater than the dangers of cap They dont want communism whatsoever so they want to donate to the free market politican but knows by doing so they could hurt homosexual rights Who should the individual in question donate to if they should at all,Who should people donate to,0
First I m gonna tell some of my opinions I believe in all drugs decriminalization hope I spelled it right and I frequently use marijuana I strongly believe guns should be free to circulate and there s should be just a little background check to see that you are not a criminal or an insane person I strongly believe in public healthcare and education I like the government only when it works for the people I think taxes are necessary for a functioning society but they could be lowered by a lot if the government only spent them on things that actual benefits people some services should be privatized and some taxes are useless because they aren t useful for the people like bombing kids in Syria I believe in free trade everyone should be free to sell and buy everything they want as long as nobody was hurt in the process I think the NAP google it if you don t know it is a good system I believe in open borders and gay marriage and every other lgbt right I m obviously not racist against no one except for mosquitoes I oppose political correctness when it isn t needed PC is necessary in like kids stuff cause it s meant also to teach things I oppose cancel culture even if I think it s mosto of the times overblown by the media and it always existed is some way I m a bit uncertain on minimum wage but it depends I believe that every victimless crime should be legal That s it I guess I always used to call myself a centrist but now I m a bit unsure What am I,What is my closest political label,0

I was speaking with a Cuban American friend of mine last night about the Elian Gonzalez situation back in To no surprise he was VERY passionate about Janet Reno and the US being wrong about sending Elian back to Cuba with his father His view was that Elian s mother was the sole custodian for him and made the decision to come to the United States ultimately dying in the process I don t think it can be debated that her wishes for Elian were for him to grow up in America and not Cuba Of course when the mother died she no longer had parental rights and Janet Reno felt that the law stated the father should be the guardian of the child I m sure we all remember the photo of Elian being pulled from a closet at gunpoint by federal agents I did some research and found that Elian is quite the Castro loyalist Even going as far as saying that he isn t religious but if he were to worship a god it would be Fidel Castro Of course Elian now says he wanted to be in Cuba and agrees with the US government decision to send him back You can make a very strong argument that had Janet Reno not made the decision to send him back to Cuba Cuban American voters in Miami would have stayed loyal to Democrats and Gore would have won the election then all the snowballing effects from there on out So what could Attorney General Reno have done differently She was very clear about her interpretation of the law and custody rights going to the father Was there any wiggle room in her interpretation that would have allowed Elian to stay Would it have been possible for her to delay things further allowing Congress to take action and change the law,What other options did Jano Reno have to solve the Elian Gonzalez situation,0

Hi As a non Chinese and non American I was curious if you could help me clarify certain things From what I can understand the Taiwan problem was the result of a civil war in China The defeated side took shelter on the island away from the mainland and was able to survive due to US military support As the time passed the new generations born on Taiwan were becoming more and more anti PRC and anti unification and it culminated in modern Taiwan population who consider themselves an independent state and it seems like everyone pretty much supports Taiwan against evil and aggressive PRC However it we project this situation on US history who also had a civil war would the modern US government and US population tolerate and recognize the independence of let s say Long Island if it was occupied by confederates who fled there after their defeat in civil war I m not familiar with US geography so I couldn t find an island that would be of same importance to US as Taiwan is to China so feel free to correct me I understand that PRC is not likeable in western countries and hence why they re supporting Taiwan but isn t this whole thing an internal affair of China,Taiwan Island US analogy,0

For a long time it seems the lab leak hypothesis was a incredibly controversial topic if not an outright taboo subject Those who did consider it were deemed conspiracy theorists Even now there seems to be a lot of resistance to exploring this hypothesis and giving the public some solid information about the virus origins So why does no one seem to consider this hypothesis Does the US government not encourage anti Chinese propaganda from time time In light of the ongoing rivalry between the US and China why isn t the Wuhan lab hypothesis considered a good opportunity to turn international public opinion against China,Why is there so much resistance to the Lab Leak hypothesis,0

I want to preface this by saying a few days ago and several years ago I lost my big brother in Kabul That is why I ask this I wish I could have known his thoughts So it s a complex topic but in short the CIA and US military openly supported fringe fundamentalist Jihadists in the Socialist Afghan country which was seen as a Soviet puppet state These fundamentalists were angry with the taxes the federalization the egalitarianism women were given rights and so on They did this with supplying everything from weapons to training to funding and eventually schoolbooks and everything required to make a government in the s Notably Green Berets American Army special forces known for being highly educated taught to speak native languages and train native forces on horses fought and eventually the Communist government asked the USSR to intervene When this happened the USSR attempted to use armored vehicles and helicopters so the U S began providing anti tank weapons and even STINGER missiles anti aircraft rockets The signature look of Osama Bn Laden was literally an American military jacket given to him in He was referred to as an Anti Soviet Freedom Fighte r in American media The ending credits of Rambo were dedicated to Al Qaeda and the Mujihadeen The entire movie literally depicts a Green Beret supporting them The other symbol Bin Laden used a lot was an AKS a cut down AK only given to Soviet armored vehicle crewmen pilots and special forces It s basically a symbol of pride I just wanted to add that He s using it as a trophy So I mean if you fight there as a soldier or fought there in the past years you could be fired at with a weapon supplied by the U S military decades ago by terrorists given institutional knowledge by the U S If you actually read Bin Laden s writings he s saying he s pissed that the U S used them as a proxy force he s pissed Muslims are being massacred by NATO and he wants revenge How do you morally understand this I mean the government created them your predecessors decades ago made them and it bit us ALL in the ass when they came for blood in planes,So not to be inflammatory but how do American troops feel about the U S government s role in creating the Taliban,0
If I want people from a majority oppressor group to take me and my movement seriously I wouldn t want to talk down to the people I am trying to reach across the aisle to have join my movement and attach a negative attribute to their identity because their people have been largely responsible for my people s oppression It s counter intuitive and only serves to increase racial tensions What is the point in using this term,Do you think Leftists using the term white fragility are doing more harm than good,0

I am having a debate with a right winger on subjects pertaining to improving the position and status of black people in society He believes programs like affirmative action are keeping black people down and that true equality involves allowing people equal opportunity Equality of opportunity trumps equality of outcome according to him Otherwise it is not equality but equity I feel that equity is the tool with which to achieve equality in the long run and eventually we ll be at a point where programs like affirmative action will be no longer necessary This person thinks MLK likely would have been a Trump supporter and that the Republican party does more for blacks on virtue of not holding their hand basically I m not sure of the best way to challenge his equality vs equity approach because I know his beliefs about Republicans being better for black people is absolute nonsense,Are equity and equality mutually exclusive,0

Obviously there s the stereotype about them being backwards and conservative which I ll admit isn t too far off if you go to the South the Midwest the West excluding the coasts or for that matter any rural area that s too far from a city But at the same time I ve seen a lot of equally rural areas elsewhere that weren t particularly progressive I currently live in Seattle and I ve spent a lot of time in both Washington and Oregon as well is British Columbia and Alberta Both countries have extremely progressive cities Seattle Portland and Vancouver while they also have plenty of pretty conservative areas Eastern Washington Eastern British Columbia and just about all of Alberta Off hand I know that they re pretty progressive when it comes to legalizing marijuana as only a handful of countries Canada included have made it fully legal while multiple states have legalized it completely the federal government is largely under the control of states in the regions I mentioned earlier Another one is granting citizenship to everyone born within our borders which is almost unheard of in Europe Also there are plenty of people who support universal healthcare affordable college myself included and many other social and economic changes like the ones that other countries already so it s not like everybody s content with the status quo again the federal government is being held hostage by the ultra conservative states Also the Dems seem to be pretty good about abortion and gun control despite their numerous shortcomings elsewhere I ll admit they aren t a particularly progressive party maybe center left on a good day which is why I always vote Green And same sex marriage was allowed only a little after the average for all other similar countries only a few years after most of them and a few years before some again Canada was an outlier not the norm also many states allowed it years before the federal government did What I ve noticed is that the people are pretty mainstream when it comes to social issues while the conservatives tend to be holding us back on economic issues particularly although they re behind on a lot they aren t able to stand in the way of same sex marriage quite the same as they can with universal healthcare or climate action Meanwhile the liberals I m referring to the people not Biden Obama Clinton etc type career politicians are pretty much in line with progressives from any other country But back to my main question are some progressive things the United States does that other similar countries don t,What are some ways in which the United States is more progressive than other similar countries such as Canada Australia or countries in Europe,0

Not american but I was reading about your country s parties and found out Democrats were the far right party back when slavery existed and retained some elements afterwards Now I know the Democrats represent the left wing in America generally There are some centrist right wingers perhaps like Biden or Clinton Manchin from what I read is conservative but I wonder if there s a State maybe Alabama or Kansas idk where Democrats are still conservative perhaps even from what I read the far right Dixiecrats or are they a thing of the past Btw I m talking more social conservative than anything else not fiscally So you could be tax the rich pro union universal healthcare but extremely religious anti LGBT etc,Do conservative far right Democrats still exist,0
The demographic argument has many opponents but it makes a lot of sense So typically when a majority group of a particular race or religion is increasing in percentage we tend to see a large percentage from the majority identifying as liberals When the opposite happens where the majority decreases in percentage they tend to become more conservative and support their own For example US experienced a high influx of Europeans during and post WW It dramatically increased its White majority and this may be the primary reason for the social justice movements of the s In India for example the Hindu majority grew after partition and it allowed for a secular Congress to rule the country for decades As Whites in US kept decreasing in percentage we are seeing a gradual decrease of percentage of White liberals and support for very pro White leaders amongst the community The same can be said of India in regards to Hindu nationalism If the trend continues then US in the future will be like Brazil where Whites become even more inward looking and a lot of half Whites begin identifying as Whites What do you think about this reasoning and prediction,Is America s race politics heavily influenced by its demography,0
There seems to be a lack of official statements regarding Biden s stance on China In contrast Trump was very vocal on his accusations against the PRC Whether this was for good or worse Trump viewed China as a threat to the US and took some steps to combat it Will Biden be soft on China just like Obama I remembered Obama refusing to apply the Republic of the Philippines United States Mutual Defense Treaty when the Philippines asked the US for help with China s island grabbing in the South China Sea I m genuinely curious,How will Biden deal with China,0
Every time trump does bad things or says something racist Republicans always bring up something a democrat may or may not have done like the myth that democrats started the kkk So by that logic trump s father was in the KKK so by default they are admitting that the whole trump family was apart of the racist white supremacist democrats,Why do Republicans bring up the myth that democrats started the kkk when ever trump is under fire,0
Help with a personal project I ve decided that I want to read interpret and compare a selection of philosophical and political books and write a lengthy comparative essay describing how each of these books influenced my personal philosophy and how they differ The books I ve chosen for this are Gender Trouble by Judith Butler Beyond Good and Evil by Nietzsche The Genealogy of Morals by Nietzsche The Foucault Reader by Michel Foucault History of Western Philosophy by Bertrand Russel The Coming Revolution Julius Malema and the Fight for Economic Freedom by Janet Smith Women Race and Class by Angela Davis An Anatomy of Fascism by Robert Paxton I m still a bit confused about how I ll be able to link these books together I also have a feeling that I should rather focus on one category in particular this selection seems quite broad to me I m from South Africa so maybe I could write in a Post Apartheid context On either philosophy or politics I haven t read much philosophy before but I ve accumulated a fair knowledge of politics I m wondering how I could link the two together Or if I should rather focus on one I feel that philosophy would be much easier to write personally about than politics I m still in high school so I haven t had much experience with this kind of writing and comparison apart from the occasional history essay The main reason I ve chosen to do this is because I want to broaden my understanding of philosophy and the politics of my country A secondary reason is that I m considering doing a degree involving philosophy and politics Thanks for your suggestions in advance Edit left out one of the books,Help with a personal project,0

I know this is probably going to get downvoted into oblivion for even mentioning his name but this is a legitimate question I ve listened to many of his lectures and I ve also studied leftist theory quite a bit I do think JBP got some things wrong trying to connect marxism to postmodernism and I think he s a bit paranoid of postmodernism and the radical left I also think he s misrepresented marxism in general at times But after listening to him a lot it seems to me like his fundamental message is there are principles of the west that are worth preserving hence conservativism but as the world evolves change is also necessary liberalism we just need to be very careful about how we implement change as we move forward It s very difficult to implement positive change so it should be examined carefully before moving forward Something like that He s even pro universal Healthcare and pro psychedelic research which are both usually associated with the left politically He sounds more like a moderate to me maybe even a moderate Democrat who s just very opposed to the far left Thoughts,How is Jordan Peterson a conservative,0
Back in conservatives overwhelmingly supported the War in Iraq and bullied anyone who raised objections A decade on they changed their minds and accepted the war was a mistake and that Bush and Cheney were scoundrels As far as I can tell conservatives never looked at themselves in the mirror and questioned how could they have been so foolish and how they should change their thinking patterns to avoid repeating their mistake But I live in Belgium and do not know Americans beyond what I read in the news and on conservative message boards Did you guys notice any substantial soul searching by conservatives after the War in Iraq,Did conservative Americans ever do any introspection after they realized the War in Iraq was a mistake,0

Trump supporters have touting fraud for months and now everything is coming to a head A recount over weird voting totals in NH was solved certain folding machines were creating lines through candidate names causing machines to make mistakes The vote total was different on a recount but not enough to change the results Meanwhile in AZ that freak show is hitting the rails They have already concluded that dominion machines were NOT changing ballots and the state is realizing that the way they are conducting the recount is so bad that they are already talking about doing another recount but this time by an independent and professional company Not only did they waste weeks looking for watermarks and bamboo in the ballots but now they arent going to add any ballots that THEY deem suspicious into their final count In GA the trump supporters won a lawsuit to access their ballots Only they arent allowed to touch the originals they say they will send copies to experts to check the ballots authenticity How can you check if a ballot is real by looking at a copy lol No other states are considering a recount in a serous manner Sure some state republicans the ones that will be running for re election soon will play games and hint at recounts until they are reelected The trump supporters having no understanding of basic civics think that if enough fraud is discovered that it will cause a new confirmation and trump will be sworn in and put biden in jail yadda yadda When in actuality the worst that could happen is biden would be impeached IF they could prove he knew about it Under the constitution you cant be held liable for crimes committed by others in your name if you had no knowledge So far there have been lawsuits audits recounts an attack on the capitol and still biden was sworn in because thats what the constitution demanded Do you think trump supporters will ever accept results that show trump didnt win So far they havent,do you think audit fever will catch on Or do you think it will die,0

I read that a potential new tax agenda will raise the tax rate to on households making over million My father makes around per year but lives in a now expensive market where he planned to sell his home for over million and move somewhere cheaper keeping gains as his retirement plan But the new capital gains tax proposal appears to obstruct this plan Does anyone have more understanding of the proposal It seemed like any asset reported like after selling a home would count towards hitting this million threshold for paying in tax so anyone who sells a home worth more than that but is this true I saw a quote Some have speculated that this will hit middle class home sellers who sell a home in an expensive market and have more than million of capital gains from real estate but this is very rare Even in markets where home prices are over million most of that is still serviced by debt not all equity but I don t quite understand I guess I m just looking for extra clarity understanding Thanks,Biden s tax plan on real estate,0
The recount team was supposedly looking for traces of bamboo in the ballot paper to see if the ballots were printed in China or whatever Is it even a thing in China to mix bamboo into paper pulp I personally wouldn t be too concerned if they were printed in China but since hearing this claim I ve tried to look into it and can t even find confirmation that Chinese paper would have traces of bamboo I found an article talking about how bamboo is currently used htm text Last year C Sichuan produced to the Sichuan Paper Association amp text China lacks forest and timber but is rich in bamboo to make soft delicate industrial paper like toilet paper and tissues but that s pretty far from the relatively rigid card like paper used for ballots Everyone discounted this as racism but is the claim so racist that even the premise of Chinese paper production is false,AZ Recount Question about some of the claims,0

This would be if they mostly have what they want or if directly what they want is unpopular I E Trump or his supporters who have high property values and enough money to retire so long as they dont send their kids to university or rednecks trying to clamp down on colored folks because at least they re aren t that poor work and decrepit without their dignity To quote Lydon Baines Jhonson If you can convince the lowest white man he s better than the best colored man he won t notice you re picking his pocket Hell give him somebody to look down on and he ll empty his pockets for you,Couldn t conspiracy theories just be causus belli for the powerful,0
I m pondering this not to take sides but rather to inspect what real positive effect this Hamas activity has for Palestine as a country as people and also its relations with Israel I understand that from the POV of Palestine Israel is the enemy and oppressor But given that Israel has such a well funded and perfected military complex and most of their attacks are almost guaranteed to fail why put so much money in these rockets Isn t it more or less just a waste of time and resources that causes further aggravation Not to mention that an Israeli retaliation is guaranteed so Palestine WILL be hit back as soon as another rocket is fired So if this is the case how come Hamas activity is still so high Doesn t it just hurt Palestine in the long run And I don t mean this in the sense of making Palestine look bad or giving Israel reasons to retaliate that is not what I m focusing on and I m not asking whether Israel is justified I m focusing on the direct impact on the country of Palestine and its people,Why does Hamas keep shooting rockets at Israel when the IDF is so much more powerful,0
I ve been seriously pondering this for the last few weeks mainly due to the realization that my most important convictions have not been supported by either side or any third party in the last few decades These are mainly on foreign policy I don t really want to delve into it but I take a stance that is fairly hawkish but completely loathes how Bush handled foreign policy and ruined the image of the ideas at stake As well as completely misunderstood the trade off and neccesities of keeping the policy popular and fiscal policy something that is even more unpopular than my foreign policy like entitlement reform and balancing budgets Something that not even Reagan did I don t however like being partisan and hate how tribal it has gotten and have real concerns with how it pertains to democracy Also online politics has gotten pretty cringy and childish you have to realize most of the popular idealogies have younger communites like populists and progressives my ideas and interests are probably more in line with folk who skew older tame and lame I suppose it is because I m more of a pragmatist than anything else but I m about ready to throw in the towel That s not to say I won t associate locally or even at the state level but national politics is just a grim reminder to me that I m no longer the target audience I can contend with a decent portion of partisanship you have to realize it s fundamentally a caveat of democracy but otherwise my ideas are despised by both coalitions and every third party It doesn t help that the GOP s main support is derived from voters who don t support anything I am a proponent of and this has been going on for decades look at any state TREND not swing map going back to and see where GOP support has gotten stronger and weaker in and you ll see that my ideas have been on borrowed time from the s php year amp off amp elect amp f I think that considering what most people in the country want that neither side wants me in the game now that I really should stop fighting the winds that have been building up since I m never going to win and I am only causing issues in a side that has been disassociating with me since And I don t have disdain for that it s democracy after all If the party wants to cater to its base that s been naturally gravitating towards it for the last quarter century and stop trying to make a play for a group that has been doing the opposite in the same time frame suburbs is it really the party s fault If my faction failed to convince or have power in the party for nearly three decades what does it say about the ideas I don t want an argument I know there is no point in fighting the majority of all sides at this point I just want an honest opinion Because I ve invested too much time into this and it just hurts to realize you have lost so spectacularly for nearly three damn decades I just want to know if I should cut my losses now,Should I Just Leave Politics,0
So as I understand it Hamas attacked first and refused some deals But Israel has settlers colonizing the West Bank and is now also attacking places in Gaza killing innocent civilians in the proces They have also blocked virtually every way in or out of Gaza They blame all this on Hamas attacking first or just Hamas still being in power So could there be peace or even a deal worked out between both parties if Hamas was overthrown in some kind of revolution and a new less hostile government took power democratically or not,Would Israel stop attacking if Hamas was overthrown,0
Can someone debunk this,Did Trump actually win of election lawsuits,0
I recall recently there were still a few holdouts about this in the past few weeks maybe on this subreddit Am frankly amazed that anyone would think this given the enormous body of evidence from law enforcement the court charges the news and from the insurrectionists themselves Here s one pithy tweet about the whole thing ref url https A F Fboingboing net F F F Fwatch gqp reps claim capitol riot was a normal tourist visit html,Are there actually people who believe the January insurrection wasn t violent,0
I know the conflict has been going on for a while now and that there are tragic stories but I never understood the concept I have a very very basic understanding of the situation but I see it on the news and everywhere more and more often and it is weird for me Here is my probably too simplistic take As far as I know the issue is with Palestine wanting territorial and political thus general autonomy as a country and Israel doesn t want that because it is our land My stance If any community province city county wants autonomy and votes and referendums in the community prove that a majority want to have their own country and they are able to create a legal and political apparatus to run the country what kind of historical juidical religious reason can there possible be to stop them from doing that I don t get it I think the issue should have nothing to do with either terrorists or Jews with religions history or economics It is simply a question of the autonomy of a community of humans which I believe is far more important than economic or historical issues I think it is a basic human rights issue So could someone please explain to me what is the grand scheme and possibly the detailed issue videos about it are ALL massively biased in either direction and mostly on a religious basis or perhaps just confirm my idea that it is yet again about politicians playing chess with innocent lives,Could someone explain the Israel Palestine situation,0
do you think im a fascist because i have some very unusual ideas but no other fascist that ive met believes what i do but i read the definition of fascism and its basically Authoritarian glorifying the past rallying people against an enemy that ruined the world and nationalism and i meet those requirements here is what i believe im economically left aka im a socialist communist and i agree with marx i support LGBT rights and i think BLM is good i think those people of colour should riot its the only way to get your voice heard and im very simpathetic of antifa but i glorify a near mythical past from before christianity and i want to return to a pre christian world and a big part of fascism is glorifying the past and i want to rally everyone against christians muslims and jews because i believe the abrahamic religions have ruined the world also another big part of fascism is having an enemy that we all rally against also i think selectively breeding human beings is a good idea because the concept has been very successful in other species and humans are just animals too also im a nationalist i think we should look after the people in our own nation first before helping others but i dont want ethnonationalism everyone regardless of ethnicity who is part of my nation is to be protected but nationalism is part of facism also im very Authoritarian but i dont like the current system so in practise im not very authoritarian in this current system but my perfect system would be an Authoritarian one because i dont trust the masses to run everything without oversight because most people are stupid,am I technically a fascist by definition because i believe things that technically fit the definition but the things i believe are mostly associated with the left,0

Just curious If Trump runs again I think it s clear his platform will be the election was stolen and we need to right a wrong However other Republican s will run against him they will have to take the position that Joe Biden won the election and there was no fraud otherwise they might as well not be in the race Am I missing something How can anyone run against Trump and say the election was a fraud They would be handing him the nomination They would have to argue it was a fair election free of fraud and Trump lost How in the world could any R do that and hope to win the Trump base,Trump,0
I was kind of taken aback recently when people criticized Biden for keeping the refugee cap at only Now people is an incredibly large number for a country such as the United States that has so many unemployed due to covid and we literally have millions of homeless on the streets who could use a job and support The refugees get housing and money every month and I personally feel Americas poor deserve those services I also recall people on the left saying overpopulation is bad for climate change well brining in refugees and illegal aliens is counter productive to that Also in a time of covid how is letting in millions from other nations a good idea Dont we need the borders and immigration blocked for now until this pandemic is over,Why do so many people on the left seem to champion abortion because America is overpopulated and yet also champion endless flood of immigration and refugees Is this not hypocritical considering leftist viewpoints on the poor climate change and covid as well,0
Whenever I feel motivated to familiarise myself with ME politics I ll typically just start to read about it s history By that I mean the end of the Ottoman Empire WWI and WWII etc in the hopes of being provided some context However that s been to my detriment because I basically know nothing about the contemporary situation There s also a lot of different things going on re Israel Palestine Syria etc so I m not even sure where to start because I m not sure how linked all of this is or what caused it etc Any good resources or answers I can find here Thanks,Complete novice in Middle Eastern politics where to start,0

In a democracy everyone should have a voice but to me banning voting for people who are felons and Excons are suppressed barred from it Why Why is democracy for everyone but not for them Why do we do this This isn t democracy And people that support this backed up with the amendments are not realizing the suppression of peoples freedoms and voices they are creating So why support this,We have the right to vote why can t felons and or criminals vote,0

My friend is fairly uninformed on politics She said today yeah I support trump but like I don t have flags or anything those people are weird I personally am under the impression that Mr Trump while he does appeal to the evangelical conservative vote with extreme policies against abortion and transgenderism he himself is not faithful in the slightest If my view is wrong please correct me Otherwise please cite somewhere were the former president has been recorded being anti christian I think I m getting through to my friend and she says that the only reason she supports him is because she believes he helps christians,In what ways has former president trump acted Anti Christian,0

So when do we get to have a real conversation about the human rights apocalypse that is present day mexico and what their neighboring nation home to both the most globally expansive and expensive military on the planet is going to do about it the situation has been dire for well over a decade now and at the end of the day we ve taken no major notable steps that actually could result in ending it long term or short term thousands of unidentified often mutilated bodies every year kidnapping for ransoms progressed beyond wealthy families to those stricken with poverty in the s and on occasion even when they do successfully scrape together every dime possible from everyone they know to get their child back the kid still get murdered i happened upon an article yesterday not even in search for news of any genre somehow that briefly mentioned the state government reporting that college students studying film had been kidnapped and dissolved in barrels of acid shortly after an official publicly stated that no traces of the boys were found in the acid raising concerns about the governments involvement his year old daughter and her best friend both went missing and were both undoubtedly slain yet here we are building walls to keep people locked inside that hell and wall or not with violence heightened at this sort of catastrophic level our own are also at risk especially those who live closest to the region and why are half of the drugs being traded even still illegal here prohibition was ended what the hell is the difference that alcohol presents it too harms vital organs and inebriates the user and yet we even encourage people to do it outside of their own homes with bars and nightclubs built around destinations of consumption with little to no regard of sufficient public transportation to and from those locations prison isn t a safe route to recovery for any addict at all so when we simultaneously watch the shockingly detrimental outcome of each domino that falls as product of outlawing addictive substances like this why are we still clinging desperately to these solutions that have proven both circumstally ineffective in remedying the issue intended as well as critically harmful to entire regions caught in the middle of unlawful unregulated unsafe production and distributions of these outlawed substances mexico isnt our spit bucket we can do a hell of a lot better than subjecting them to this horror then insisting they remain there in the living hell that we created for them the rise of mexican drug cartels seems to coincide with the american war on drugs this aint it so what do we do to fix this now,when do we get to actually talk about mexico,0

I believe that both the government and companies should have less power but not eliminated completely like libertarians and socialists want i want the government to leave me alone on things like what I do with my girlfriend in bedroom if we are consensual what I watch on the internet etc but I want public healthcare and schools But I don t want corporations to have the power they have now they turn kids in Africa into slaves and they would kill my cat for money but I don t want them to be completely eliminated just less power so I just want the government and the corporations to have less power what is my label Edit it s useless to say that I support weed legalization and lgbt,What is my political ideology,0
I m autistic and I for one don t understand the undeserved current hatred towards Asian Americans just because some mentally challenged orange demagogue unfairly blamed them for a pandemic which he helped spread with his rallies whilst instigating riots I for one like Asian Americans because they empower our country they ve designed and built much of America s critical infrastructure like our railroads I can t imagine a united States without Asian Americans otherwise everything would be boring I personally think that Asian Americans should get a national holiday celebrating them and their predecessors and ancestors for helping build the foundation for a modern united States,Why the Asian hate,0
Title says it all I am under the impression that a hate crime can occur with anyone of any race So what is it about these new anti asian hate crime laws that are different than the laws that are already in place As far as I know any sort of hate crime label that gets slapped onto a charge very significantly increases the sentencing So I can t really see them really making sentencing even harsher specifically for an Asian hate crime,How are the new Asian hate crime laws different from hate crime laws already in place,0
Pretty much no one thinks that situation at the border with kids being kept in ICE holding facilities for too long is good although people are quibbling about if it is really a crisis but I haven t really heard any ideas about how the situation on the ground can be addressed right now I understand the biggest problem is lack of facilities which can t be built overnight but other problems like underfeeding poor hygiene lack of medical care kids who have relatives ready to take care of them still being held seem like we should be able to solve them quickly So what policies should the Biden admin be pursuing to address the problem in the short term Is he pursuing them but he needs congress or they take time to implement Please don t answer with things that would make the situation worse like close the border or send them all back,What specific policies should Biden be implementing to address the humanitarian situation at the border and why has he not done them or has he and It just takes time,0
I ve heard it being defined as The right to say anything you want without getting punished for it But who is responsible for this punishment Who is the punisher I ve heard about college professors being sacked for expressing their opinion on a controversial topic Some say that this is an infringement on freedom of speech others doesn t Those who doesn t say that you re only protected from freedom of speech from authorities The US state can t punish you for expressing your opinion about a topic But in my mind this defeats the whole purpose of freedom of speech because the exactly the same consequences will happen when people can t express themselves freely whether or not it s the general public or the authorities who punish them Professors employees people will abstain from expressing their opinion in fear of being fired and this is exactly what freedom of speech should defend against Imagine a society with this freedom speech where people can t get punished FROM AUTHORITIEs by saying what they want But in this society if you say something controversial nobody will hire you because they don t want to be associated with you In this society very little thought ideas and discussions would be interchanged In this society I would not say that they have freedom of speech Sorry for bad English I m not an English speaker and it s like AM I just couldn t stop thinking about this,What is freedom of speech,0

First off if you haven t seen the latest pentagon UFO disclosures in a while I recommend taking a little time to peak down the rabbithole They re starting to report nuclear deactivation in association with UFO encounters which corroborates decades old reports from the Kremlin I think Marco Rubio is the first serving senator I ve heard acknowledge these UFO reports Harry Reid CpnGBI was neck deep but never uttered a word about it until he was out of office and didn t have to sweat reelection Nobody wants to talk about it due to the woo woo tinfoil hat speculation and the stigma that comes from the woo woo speculation Even when they explain that the U in UFO stands for Unidentified About years ago I would have dismissed anybody that brought them up too I really didn t find the topic interesting until the pentagon confirmed the cockpit footage and radar data from the releases as authentic,Is UFO talk a political death sentence,0

So Congress is discussing making DC a state which would lead to states Personally as much as I d like somewhere as blue as DC having its own senators in the US I like even numbers and multiples of so states is perfect That being said let s say we merge like North and South Dakota to make the state of Dakota Then two republican senators from the Dakotas would be replaced by two democrats from DC Is it legal for a country to merge two of its states Not to be rude to anyone from the Dakotas but I think it s kinda pointless to have two of them and not just one Dakota They re basically the same politically and culturally but one has Mt Rushmore,Is it constitutional to merge two states together,0

Greetings r AskPolitics I was wondering if you could help me figure out what a family member of mine is talking about in a recent FB post They claimed Biden signed an XO that ended a VA program that allows veterans to seek healthcare from civilian hospitals and doctors if the VA had no availability within a day window or if the proper medical treatment wasn t available at the VA facility I believe the program in question is the Veterans Choice Program but am not sure This is a program started under Obama in and expanded under Trump in I checked the federal register and cannot find any XO that rescinds the program in part or in whole Then again I didn t read the entire text of every Order Action I did find a few articles expressing concern that the expansion of the program under Trump was more about privatization than about helping veterans So perhaps the new VA director could have made some changes to the program in that light Still I m not seeing anything in particular Regardless apparently my family member is left without a treatment program now because of some changes and has to start over which does suck Mostly I m just trying to understand if this is really a bad thing done by the Biden administration or if it s one of those damned if you do damned if you don t situations where a change was made that is better for all in the long run but temporarily leaves some veterans in a bind,Biden Executive Order on Veterans Affairs,0
Not trying to sound islamophobic in any way it s just based on observation on the news and past events I ve noticed over like since I was a toddler in from watching the news there is always a fight in Iraq Syria and Afghanistan mainly focused on terrorism There s always a new terrorist group created by Muslim extremists like Isis Al Qaeda Boko Haram and the Taliban Why does this keep on happening why don t they give up and do you think this war will ever end Also I am aware there are other terrorist groups that are Christian other religions but this seems more common in the middle east,Why is there a reoccurrence every few years that a new terrorist group has formed in the middle east,0

I think the Voter ID thing is BS personally but I m always annoyed when nobody counter offers Voter ID bills by proposing a program to make sure everyone in the country has a functional ID card Even if I think voter fraud is rare enough that the system doesn t need additional verification I understand how it could be a valid concern to someone The Democratic party s argument against ID laws tends to be it takes time money and resources that many people can t spare to stand in line at the DMV only to be told you re missing a document and have to come back and then go back another day with the right documents and hopefully nothing else goes wrong This happens more frequently to people of color therefore Voter ID policies are racist I pretty much agree with this but as I said it never presents the possible solution of just getting IDs to people So if people actually care about the vote being from verified citizens would they also support measures to make it less of a nightmare to become verified in the first place I m not against requiring people to present their ID if I m confident that there s no good reason they wouldn t have one But right now there s like a million reasons that I would forgive someone for not having official documents on their person There s a lot of little issues that could be helped by a robust ID system too It would obviously be kind of expensive but if people are willing to storm the capital over a wonky vote maybe they could chip in a few bucks for a trustworthy system,What would you Democrats Republicans think of a bill that requires Voter ID but also mandates a comprehensive nationwide program to actually get everyone an ID card for free,0

Hey I m an eighteen year old agender assigned female at birth person I also have ocd and I like girls I ve lived in nyc my entire life so basically everyone I know is politically on the left However I ve recently been questioning a lot of things I ve been raised to believe are true I ve made a lot of posts here about wanting to remove my vagina or wanting a girl to top dom me Both of those are things I m actively working on However im still a person I m honestly not sure where this paragraph was meant to go Just don t judge me I ve always been told right wingers we re bigoted and would want me dead for being agender or for liking girls But I ve been thinking and I actually might be more conservative then I thought Here s some reasons A I m beginning to get a lot of soft bigotry from my peers They always treat me as a prop or some sort of special person just for being enby A lot of them are weirdly soft on me and sort of treat me like a child pulling punches and all that At this point it just feels like a different candy coated form of hate At this point I d rather be called dy e then soft boi B New York and America have been kind of hurt by a lot of democrats policy Covid has been awful and I hate the fact that I can t do things that people from Texas can And Biden didn t follow up on a single thing he promised we still have kids in cages and we still have drones in Iraq C I honsestly hate left wing censorship If there s one thing I will always stand for its free speech I hate what many call cancel culture People should not be censored by giant companies or angry mobs and I expected the left I knew back when I was a kid to know that D I hate the socail pressure I feel super afraid to speak my mind around me freinds A single slip up and I m a traitor to the leftist cause If I said a single thing I said here to my freind group I would be I m physical danger E the left just seems super anti sex That s it F I also just found myself straight up not liking socialism or gun control I honestly hate myself sometimes for thinking some of this stuff These types of thoughts make me feel like such a terrible person sometimes Im in such a bubble here in new York I ve never even met a right winger or faced right wing bigotry Please don t hate me for anything I say here I just want to understand myself better I understand that I m probably just a bad person,I m a left leaning person I ve begun to question my left leaning surroundings Any advice What am I,0
As someone who keeps up with the CRS after reading Jared P Cole amp Todd Garvey s report Impeachment and the Constitution I have certainly found myself with some questions and likewise confusion with regard to the four presidential impeachments With special focus on the section Recurring Questions about Impeachment pages I find myself questioning whether or not any of the charges rose to the level of a high crime or misdemeanor Why why not And on the other hand should a former official be held accountable by impeachment for conduct while they were in office Why why not,Impeachment inquiry,0
I am a somewhat educated person re politics But when I delve into reading on this subject it gets confusing My understanding is that traditionally a filibuster was an attempt to stall the process of passing a law in the house or senate by simply grandstanding on a subject until everyone just gives up and walks away It takes votes to stop someone from speaking so it takes votes to stop a filibuster One fictional example being the speech given by fake senator Jimmy Stewart in Mr Smith goes to Washington In fact this one example is poly sci for many Americans of a certain age as pertains to a filibuster My understanding of the modern process is that the Senate at least has an agreement where that physical grandstanding is no longer necessary They now agree that someone could grandstand therefore they agree not to pass a law unless it passes with at least votes because someone opposing could filibuster if they want and nobody wants to have to sit there so the threat alone is enough to halt the process In reality it only takes votes in the Senate but they don t pass laws with under if an opposing member so much as whispers filibuster Is this correct Are we halting progress at this point simply to avoid the threat of a long speech,Do I understand the modern filibuster,0

Mostly I m concerned with how a legitimate government such as a democracy with laws and lack of outright murder of citizens might arise out from within a state of heavy instability and fear Surely too many average citizens are afraid and are looking to back whoever will support stability and free that stability enforcer from corruption And then given this how do these end up failing State collapse It seems like some sort of system with checks and balances as the foundations has to be backed at a grassroots level then followed through with I e each step is likely littered with trouble And then what is a good example of a failing state and how the check and balances broke down,What are some examples of the beginnings of a government and the endings of a state,0

Can anyone help me to understand why Chauvin wasn t tried with st degree murder It seems that his intentions were thrown around a lot in this trial but the intention was not necessary for convicting him with the charges he faced Additionally the judge stated in the instructions to the jury prior to jury deliberation that gt With intent that with intent to or intended means that the Defendant either has a purpose to do the thing or cause the result specified or believes that the act performed if successful will cause the result It is not necessary that the Defendant have this intent in advance the necessary intent can develop during the commission of the act Intent is irrelevant to both Count II of Third Degree Murder or murder evincing a depraved mind without regard for human life but without intent and Count III Manslaughter in the Second Degree or negligence resulting in death And as for Count I Second Degree Murder gt Under Minnesota law a person causing the death of another person without intent to cause the death of any person While Cahill states that It is not necessary that the Defendant have this intent in advance in actuality it is not necessary that the Defendant have intent at all so long as it concerns Chauvin s trial Intent as defined would only become relevant in the case that Chauvin was charged with First Degree Murder Is this seeming Kafkaesque or is it just me I think a better and more succinct question of mine as a result of this is if Cahill s definition of intention sheds light on the hypothetical convictability in a First Degree Murder trial of Derek Chauvin Is simply demonstrating the truth of what Cahill stated that intention need not be in advance of the commission of the act such that intention can develop during the commission of the act enough to show the murder of George Floyd was premeditated and convict Chauvin with First Degree Murder If so why wasn t he tried with the first degree,Why wasn t Chauvin tried with st degree murder,0

The system is most fully explored here Or this article is smaller Gangof most susinctly explains it as gt Under semi parliamentary government no part of the executive is elected directly The prime minister and cabinet are selected by an assembly with two parts only one of which can dismiss the cabinet in a no confidence vote even though the other has equal or greater democratic legitimacy and robust veto power over ordinary legislation Basically he sees it as an opposite of semi presidentialism in that instead of the executive being divided into an elected president and a PM responsible to Parliament it is the legislature divided succinctly into elected chambers with the executive only responsible to one of them The other chamber becomes more akin to the separate legislative banch found in presidential systems He argues that this is a way of having a strong separation of powers without the executive personalisation found in presidentialism It should also be noted that the bicameralism found in most Parliamentary systems do not qualify for this definition as the upper houses are largely not directly elected and lack the powers or legitimacy to exercise the functions of a proper legislative branch Gangof idenifies Australia Japan and the Australian states with bicameral Parliaments as the only real examples of Semi Parliamentary systems,What do you think of the Semi Parliamentary System as explained by Steffen Gangof,0

Basically the title I m not an expert on these regimes or their history but why do a lot of Americans still think that both of these people aren t dictators despite being horribly repressive and corrupt police states I know Gaddafi did a lot of good for Libya but lots of people seem to forget how incredibly repressive and cruel he was and Libya under Gaddafi was like a North Korea of the region an isolated propagandist state with zero tolerance for critics of their supreme leader so why do people consider Ben Ali or Mubarak dictators but not Gaddafi Or even in Syria where al Assad is very authoritarian,Why do some people consider Gaddafi and al Assad to not be dictators,0

Part of this is a comment I left on a news article Since there aren t many people talking in that thread I thought I might get some answers here I hope this is the right place to post this I couldn t find a decent law subreddit that actually takes current events related questions I read this article html today As someone who knows very little about eminent domain law I d like to better understand what s going on here I may not be able to grasp the full magnitude of the situation but on a superficial level at least I can recognize how complicated it must be So If you re reading this and can give us a quick run down on what might be happening behind the scenes please respond A new administration can t just wipe away every single action of the old one there are safeguards in place to prevent that as Trump learned when he tried to repeal the ACA and other Obama era legislation Even without Covid tackling any of this would take more than days in office I feel for the landowners in such an impossible position and I d like to know can they fight this somehow So legally speaking how does eminent domain work I m unsure of what power if any the new administration has to affect the outcome of cases started under the previous president Can the Biden Administration legally dismiss this case and the others still awaiting a verdict Or because these cases have been active since and originated under a different administration is it out of their hands Is there an appeals process for the landowners Can landowners form a class action or does it have to be a case by case basis like we re seeing now Don t governmental bodies whether state or federal have to file a specific reason for use of eminent domain It s almost always infrastructure related a new road or highway expansion or something like that I might be totally wrong here and feel free to tell me if I am but generally speaking isn t each stage of a plan usually mapped out and funding secured before land home owners are even approached about it If a project falls through can t landowners fight the state feds to keep ownership of their property I ve read that eminent domain is much harder to secure the second time Something like that happened in my state a few years ago plans for a road expansion that called for demolishing a gas station and a few other buildings got out too early The surrounding buildings were empty so their owners immediately sold off but the gas station flat out refused The plans fell through then a few years later the city state got the funding sorted They tried to pull eminent domain to demolish the gas station again but the gas station challenged them and won The city state had to build their road expansion around the gas station and include two convenient entry exit points for them That gas station literally sits between two major streets and the entrance to an interstate highway How specific does a government s petition for eminent domain have to be In this specific case does it make a difference that the federal government is no longer actively planning to build a wall across the entire southern border It might be my confirmation bias speaking due to the story above but since the border wall plans are so up in the air can t landowners use that uncertainty to retain ownership of their properties at least for now If anything I asked said is wrong don t be afraid to call me out for my mistakes When If I am corrected by someone who knows about eminent domain laws I ll edit this post to reflect where I was incorrect Thanks in advance for any answers to my questions,This may not be the best place to post but can anyone help explain the legal situation happening with property owners on the border and eminent domain,0

Despite being very left wing I am generally suspicious about the government getting involved in the media As much as I would love every bigot on the internet to be silenced I understand the slippery slope argument about banning them That being said I have been listening to people on Fox Newsmax etc spew lies about Covid and the vaccines hurting everyone in the country My visceral response was they shouldn t be allowed to do this Would it be a good idea to require a producer of news i am not talking platforms or individuals right now to issue retractions when they spread misinformation that endangers the public I am not talking about your average cable news lie Hillary did Benghazi Trump works for Putin etc but like that either do or reasonably could harm public health or safety covid vaccines don t work there is a pizza parlor in DC that is a front for satanic pedophiles etc I understand that there is still a risk of abuse of power but I think if the legislation is worded strictly enough this can be minimized,Should the government require the producers of news Newpapers Television Stations etc to issue corrections when they spread misinformation that endangers the public,0

There can be drawn a lot of paralells between Obama and Carter with how their administration were perceived Both liked to paint themselves as the simple man in the white house however there s something Obama had that he could achieve with his popularity allowing him to deflect the criticisms towards his administration which Carter did not have It took a big personality like Ronald Reagan to deny Carter of his second term unlike Obama who did not face such opposition it could be said Mitt Romney tried to be that figure but could not achieve it Obama is what Carter tried to be but could not So instead the Republicans managed to turn Trump into the new Reaganm a much bigger personality to take down on Obama Trump managed to shake down the Obama administration with his personality The democrats then tried to take a return to normalcy with the previous administration vice president like Mondale Biden was that figure but unlike Mondale Biden was associated with the much more popular Obama Both Mondale and Biden tried to take down on a big personality name but whereas Mondale failed Biden succeeded,Concerning the election I have made some observations drawing paralells with the election and what makes it different this time,0

Abortion which is simply put the termination of pregnancy is a procedure done to a person that is pregnant by a medical care provider Anti abortionists do not believe pregnancies should be terminated The people on the other side of the argument wish to have access to medical services that can terminate pregnancies The government state and federal has the right to set and enforce standards of medical care That s their jurisdiction by law We have the concepts of state rights and we are free to make arraignments for interstate and international travel If a pregnant person chooses to seek services that safely terminate pregnancies they can find themselves economically fit to travel to borders where such procedure is allowed It s a situation not too different than other situations where medical care is too cost prohibitive to be obtained within borders So where do we reach consensus It s obviously not on whether pregnancies should be terminated But is it whether state federal legislatures should legislate medical care Whether the government legislative rights extend beyond your skin,Where do we come to a consensus on abortion,0
I believe that taxation is intrinsically linked with a democratic society A democratic country cannot be run without taxation as representatives i e politicians require a salary of some sort This salary comes through taxes and therefore no taxes would surely mean no representation I am arguing that government has a duty to tax its citizens as to maintain order and the smooth running of a nation but I was wondering if there were any more convincing political justifications of taxation Thanks,Do governments have the right to tax their citizens and what gives them this right,0

Hi all I m English but have lived in America for a significant portion of my life and like to think I m fairly up to date on American politics all relative obviously Anyway my major question relates to what s going on with Giana Carlo etc and other prominent conservatives being effectively silenced on twitter I can t understand how twitter are not within their right to ban whoever they choose Twitter is a private company who s users have threatened a loss in revenue if putting it mildly people with questionable views are allowed to use the platform freely In response to their potential loss in revenue less users signing up advertisers being concerned twitter have taken a business decision to ban certain users which can hurt their bottom line Surely they are well within their right to protect themselves from loss of revenue Particularly when these users are deemed to have already violated twitter code of conduct written in internet terms centuries ago In response to this other sites have come in to fill in the market parlor etc so options are still available regardless Is this not just the free market at work Would conservatives prefer public funding for twitter to ensure all users are never banned for speech Or Is this just an opinion not shared by many conservatives and is simply overrepresented in my personal experiences,Is the recent wave of conservative censorship by Twitter a direct result of Capitalism,0

Can you answer these questions for me Trump was warning about the Democrats stealing the election for months in advance Why wasn t he able to thwart their plans He had all the resources He had his boy William Barr in the Department of Justice Christopher Wray in the FBI and the Republicans running the Senate Even after the election Trump still had about two months to expose the conspiracy and have people locked up William Barr didn t lock anyone up In fact he resigned If Trump s boys couldn t make a case against the Democrats despite having all the resources doesn t that suggest the Democrats were in fact innocent Trump supporters say Mike Pence and William Barr betrayed Trump Why would they If Trump had won the election Pence could have been VP for another four years Barr could have been Attorney General for at least another four years Now they re just regular private citizens in retirement How was it in their interests to co operate with the Democrat scam Trump handpicked Mike Pence and William Barr to be his Vice President and Attorney General If these guys were deep state traitors doesn t that make Trump an idiot When election rigging happens in other countries it s always the party in power that did the rigging In the election the Republican Party was the party in power The Republicans controlled the Senate the White House the Department of Justice and the FBI If anyone was going to commit fraud it was the Republicans because they had more control over the apparatus of government So how did the Dems manage to rig the election and get away with it despite being the less powerful party,To those who think the election in Nov was stolen,0

I think Russia thought that in a week they would already conquered Ukraine men sent of the armed forces Tanks are not what it used to be the personal missiles US sent can destroy them easy Ukrainian army is much more trained that in they have nazi militias or what media calls now nationalist They have lots of civillian conscripts and they are at home The western world is emotionally with Ukraine and thats give them morale Ukrainians are resisting incredibly well no one thought this would be possible Russia army has logistic problems and the number of russian generals dead suggest that the middle ranks are not good generals in the frontline Drones are the new thing Ukrainians have some But the key point is I keep seeing everywhere things that suggest Ukranians are winning but when we see the map its obvious that Russia conquered a lot in days Media tells Ukraine is winning but Ukranian cities fall No logic only propaganda Ukranians can for sure hold the Russians and even counter attack the stretched russians but without air units its very unlikely they can push the russians Russia is winning but at great cost,Russian invasion is not going as planned by Putin but they are winning,1
Random thought but what if the elite class are trying to get the attention of alien life or get them to manifest themselves in some form so they can acquire great knowledge and technology They set up a scenario where it looks like nuclear war is going to happen and as it is such an extreme situation where human life is running the risk of going extinct alien life forms visit and disarm them make contact with us,What if all this potential war stuff is just a way to get alien life to appear,1
How to turn a microbiologist into a super villain I mean Dr Fauci I mean a bad person If anyone would bother to check copyright patents and see for themselves they would see covid and it s release was no accident It was planned many years in advance As was all the technology they left paper trails to Proof Glad you asked Here s one of MANY Pay special attention to the date this patent was filed and what specifically it was for and for all those out there who love to negatively right off anyone with proof of conspiracies as theorists and try to make them out to be a quack Have a look at the last name of the Dr filing the patent Perhaps it is YOU who is crazy to deny the proven conspiracy FACTS amongst elite families that are more like super villains than philanthropists but what do I know I was only severely defamed and kicked out of the medical field stripped of my credentials and blacklisted for exposing corruption whistleblowing then all of my documents in court were sealed to cover it up Hmm Sounds like some foul play for reaping what they sow eh USA Enjoy Oh and spread the word Nuremberg needs to happen That is all,Here s a fun one for you guys to prove to your friends that COVID was a set up for the world s reset Even people who love to shame others as conspiracy theorists have never been able to defeat this holy grail proof They have edited this site a bit since I first found the patent but still proof,1

So I was out having some drinks with a friend of mine I haven t seen in a while and we get on to the topic of vaccinations Turns out he has had all boosters etc I m unvaccinated myself He then goes on to say ah you re not anti vax are you So just go tell him that I don t see the reasoning as I m a healthy year old and it s a survival rate and that I don t like how these pharmaceutical companies are hiding data etc He then literally starts talking in gibberish trying to justify why he got it like literally shit that made no sense at all It feels like the vax has changed peoples brains or something Have any of you had any experiences like this with people you know,Anyone else experienced this when talking to friend about why they got vaccinated,1

If this was truly about COVID the FDA wouldn t be taking their sweet old time giving EUA to a vaccine that the American people technically paid for How is it that other countries have basically benefited from our taxpayer money and have been able to use this vaccine but the American people still can t get a hold of it It just goes to show that the whole point of this show was to push MRNA in as many Americans as possible They don t care if other countries use the more traditional format because the possible damage from the spike protein won t be as bad as the possible damage from the spike protein lipid nano particles possible long term MRNA complications because big pharma won t be profiting from them coming back in years time if something goes wrong Again I don t think any of them are safe I think the spike protein in itself is problematic in ways we don t fully understand yet But it s too coincidental that the FDA keeps pushing for MRNA especially Pfizer The FDA and media will trash J amp J not MRNA but if you actually look into many peoples adverse reactions they re not only happening from J amp J You ll see then bashing J amp J for Tinnitus and blood clots but then see multitudes of comments coming from people claiming they took Pfizer or Moderna and they got the exact same symptoms How are you supposed to trust these people Actions are clearly not matching up with words here When you have people like Fauci and the CDC saying things like masks don t work when there was a mask shortage to switch it around and say masks are mandatory when masks were being produced again it s just like they re lying right to your face but people still look to these people and think they know it all and have their best interests at heart I honestly have lost so much trust in the medical industry throughout these last years but what has made me feel the worst is that I have lost faith in the world around me to really think and to think about where they put their trust in They so easily give it away like it s cheap I know why some people decided to take the vaccine I myself have a family remember who got incredibly ill from COVID but to not question people who have been shown to lie time and time again is just something I can t even wrap my mind around,How is it not talked about that the U S has given BILLION to Novavax and the FDA has yet to approve the vaccine that other countries across the world have already approved and been using,1
Not hard to follow your existence is what society has given you but that doesn t mean you weren t content and lived a full life Your metaverse experience will give you every experience you don t have actually just like human chattle felt through devotion to religion The multi verse will provide you all the options you could have had that you ll experience in the meta verse but not actually Finally the great reset will provide for your physical support but you won t notice because you re lack of family and children will be provided for you with your experience in the meta verse Basically you won t be aware of how awful and unforfilling your actual life is becuase the great reset will make sure you still labor and are provided for at a minimal level while your spiritual and emotional needs are supplied by the meta verse tied to a virtual multi verse,The very public promotion of the multi verse metaverse and the great reset They re adopting medieval Christianity to make you happy that you ll be a lot poorer with less opportunity This has been done before,1
Commanding it and making it appear whenever I willed it also became easier I can even make one limb flow with this energy and that limb gets covered in Goosebumps What does goosebumps have to do with it This ecstatic energy I m talking about is present underneath your skin when you get goosebumps from positive stimulis Everyone can do this but not everyone is aware that there is some sort of energy current flowing when they get goosebumps This is your spiritual energy that comes from your energetic spiritual body Before you start replying that goosebumps are only a physical reaction and there is no such thing as an energy underneath it or that it isn t spiritual Consider this There are numerous data out there from the Indian culture under the term Vyana Vayu about how through the conscious and unconscious usage of this energy one of the physical reactions that will occur is goosebumps This energy is what we activate when goosebumps also appear Getting goosebumps is nothing compared to the euphoric feeling you can feel over your whole body or the positive benefits that gaining control of your spiritual energy can bring you Different terms from all over the world for it are Euphoria Tension Chi Prana Ecstasy Qi Vayus Aura Tummo Mana Frisson Life force Pit Rapture Ruah Ether Nephesch Chills The Force ASMR Nen Spiritual Energy and Spiritual Chills Here s a short YouTube video that goes more indepth about how you can allow it to be felt everywhere in your body,Feeling this euphoric energy surge flow throughout my whole body became possible after clearing my energetic pathways,1

So I see all the people talking about how Biden slipped up and told US troops that they will see things when they are there I haven t seen anyone talking about the part I found very odd What did he say they are going to see Women with babies and children blocking tanks saying they don t want to leave This strikes me very odd like why would they block USA tanks if they want help Are we getting the correct story Are the citizens of Ukraine trying to fight an illigitimat government installed by NWO This has been an angle I have viewed this from the beginning that maybe we aren t the world heros and all the powers that be are lying to us Just wanted to get this comment I heard out there the way I heard it Makes me uneasy at the least,I feel Biden let more slip than going to war,1

I don t know about anyone else on this sub but the idea of anyone choosing to murder other humans is inherently evil unless they have a REALLY really good reason So the fact that Russia is invading over really petty issues is not something I can accept or consider acceptable it s basically murder Putin is literally murdering Russians and Ukranians for some dumb reason However the way this way has been politicized is bizarre I ve never in my life seen people react to something like this before ever It s like being pro Ukraine has become the same as being anti racist people just virtue signaling it everywhere It s fucking weird When the united states invaded countries in the mid s it was like oh were going to war that sucks then people just lived their life Like people were upset about it but there wasn t this weird virtue signaling I also found out recently that Tucker said he hopes Russia wins As someone right leaning I don t really get how anyone can support Russia in this situation unless you re literally just trying to be contrarian This whole thing is weird as fuck Why is the president of Ukraine being put up as like a celebrity It s not normal,The pro Ukraine AND pro Russia stuff is weird,1

God is so proud of every one of us because we have overcome the devil and his lies We knew in our hearts that we do not belong to this world and we have a higher purpose than following the script to this so called life But this is only the beginning Many were called but few are chosen The ones who had discernment and see right through the lies have overcome the evil of this world and the chapter is about to end however a new one is beginning Satan is the ruler of this world and he is at the top of the pyramid but there is a more evil and insidious being at play and it threatens the very fabric of reality But good news we are the new Israelites And this time King Jesus will be the one leading us into battle for the final war against good and evil I m honored to call everyone here my brothers and sisters because we will be fighting alongside like how the Israelites did back in the Old Testaments Like how their story goes God took them out of Egypt and into the wilderness to destroy all the nations that were corrupt in His eyes Every man woman and child must be destroyed so the order can be restored Lord Jesus took out the ones that hated this life and out of this twisted and wicked world and now we must go out to do battle for Him And this time it will be an intergalactic interdimensional war against the true darkness that threatens the light We are almost at the finish line on Earth And never forget that you are the light of this world God bless,For the Saints,1

If you haven t yet been acquainted with Aleksandr Dugin the man known as the modern day Rasputin or alternately Putin s Brain allow me to introduce you Dugin has been a preeminent figure in the shadows of Russian politics since the fall of the USSR but first became known as a gnostic mystic figure member of the so called Yuzhinskii circle interested in European and Oriental mysticism black magic occultism and alchemy a group whose goal was apparently gt an attempt to found an ideology uniting all patriotic creative forces of the State Derzhava on the basis of uniform metaphisical traditions and values It is an attempt to transform politics from a fight for power into an instrument of harmonizing the imperial ethnie From here Dugin went on to author Foundations of Geopolitics a detailed outline of a plan to accomplish these goals and a book which reads like a roadmap of the last few decades A few highlights of Dugin s plan On the US gt Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism for instance provoke Afro American racists Russia should introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic social and racial conflicts actively supporting all dissident movements extremist racist and sectarian groups thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U S It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics See the MAGA and BLM movements tearing America apart On Ukraine gt Ukraine should be annexed by Russia because Ukraine as a state has no geopolitical meaning no particular cultural import or universal significance no geographic uniqueness no ethnic exclusiveness its certain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all of Eurasia and without resolving the Ukrainian problem it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics Ukraine should not be allowed to remain independent unless it is cordon sanitaire international relations which would be inadmissible See the current invasion of Ukraine On the UK gt merely described as an extraterritorial floating base of the U S should be cut off from Europe See Brexit On Germany gt Germany should be offered the de facto political dominance over most Protestant and Catholic states located within Central and Eastern Europe See Germany becoming the leader of the EU There are many other examples as well but those are some big highlights all of which Russia is well known to have both openly and covertly sought Foundations of Geopolitics became a textbook in the Academy of the General Staff Russia of the Russian military which would go a long way to explaining this but Aleksandr Dugin himself has also gone on to become an extremely prominent member of Russian intelligentsia floating in leadership circles as a trusted and revered advisor often drawing comparisons to Rasputin as well as advising Putin himself He has since published many further books outlining in even more detail his ideas one of the more recent being The Fourth Political Theory gt when appearing as a guest on Infowars for instance Dugin paradoxically claims in some ways to be antifascist but in other contexts such as his Fourth Political Theory promotes his own ideology as a kind of essential common root for fascism and communism i e a more supreme version of National Socialism In this book he also describes the ominous thought that gt The meaning of Russia is that through the Russian people will be realized the last thought of God the thought of the End of the World Death is the way to immortality Love will begin when the world ends We must long for it like true Christians We are uprooting the accursed Tree of Knowledge With it will perish the Universe References j euras j euras Dugin of Geopolitics,The Man Secretly Behind Russia s Invasion Of Ukraine,1

I want to start by saying this is a completely random theory that just popped in my head there is NO proof to back this and I m presenting it a LOOSE theory I was stuck watching an add for the new Samsung phones and I was actually laughing at how ridiculous they look with different lenses taking up of the phone and I couldn t picture ANYONE who needed that many lenses Most people use lenses max to take selfies maybe some insta pics of a beach abd if your a professional I highly doubt your using a Samsung phone for your art not judging if you do I couldn t help but think it was excessive and then this thought crossed my mind Our phones already to listen to EVERYTHING around us even when turned off It would not shock me if they are adding lenses specifically to watch and document your surroundings at the same time They could position the angles according to each lenses and have a view of your life at all times If they are recording I m sure they wouldn t be recording as often ad the voice recorder but I m sure they could be remote accessible in the event the government law officials or shady corporations want to track you or collect data on you It was a random thought but I wouldn t even be surprised to find out that s why they keep adding an excessive amount of lenses,The new generation of phones have an unnecessary amount of camera lenses Could this be for surveillance,1

So I ve stumbled down the Bohemian Grove Moloch rabbit hole at first I thought it was nonsense but the more I found like Capitol Hill one dollar bill grimes post from September etc the more I believe The only thing is all I can find on Moloch is the different interpretations of child sacrifice some say they out them in a cauldron some say they pass through flames and other say they use effigies My question is are there any prayers they use alongside this or any prayers in general for Moloch as I can t find any Surely there is some as it can t be as simple as just the sacrifice Has anyone found anything on this subject,Moloch Prayers to a diety,1
Dust is a concept in the HBO series His Dark Materials whereby it is dust that allows us to see a dimensional portal of sorts and cities in the heavens think Spice in Dune The synopsis is that there are two parallel dimensional timelines here on earth like Harry Potter The profane world is the one we commoners exist in and in the spiritual world each child has a spirit animal they can talk to who is tethered to them and the spirit animal can change forms until the child hits maturity whereby it chooses a fixed nature The dark forces in both worlds are kidnapping children and through some dark machine seperating them from their spirit animal in order to harvest the spiritual energy or Dust This kills the animal and the child They are doing this as a way to use dark or false Ascension energy to get to the cities in the sky Piecing this together so bear with me The theory is that through SRA traumatic mind control like MKUltra and Monarch and mass manipulation some are trying to invert everything Man has two legs for equilibrium and likewise there needs be two sexes for future generations The SRA and mass manipulation keeps the elite at the top through covid they are getting mRNA into humans you see the push now to get it into children This allows them to edit the genes Hijaacking the LGBTQ agenda the flag is all the colors of the chakras except upside down so the red sexual chakra is at top through pop culture propoganda hypersexualization at young age videos of innocuous pop songs being overtly satanic the sexual fluidity at such a young age leads to malleable hyper maturity disassociation from the nuclear family and the established patriarchy which becomes gender fluidity which normalizes trans sexual operations to the younger ages and opens the door to the Trans humanist agenda of gene editing patenting humans and bio tech AI singularity Much like the matrix movies red pilled a generation to seperate us from the green matrix heart chakra this inverts everything Both men and women work child bearing is done through technology in pods another matrix visual Think of all the flips in fashion and culture of rappers in dresses and a push to get women in the workplace There is a pattern of this hijack of people s movements National Revolutions Finance Tech PharmaKia Since the th Amendment Setting free slaves in the rights will not be denied to any person Corporate attorneys fought that corporations are persons This has allowed for the hijacking of micro peoples movements Right here is where the social contract was breached Don t tell me you don t see it Civil rights Feminism Gay Trans And then Boom Macro Pandemic This is where the social contract was broken They went right for the heart Literally Then Boom Macro expansion War Food shortages The Not so great Reset is made of little resets We ll call them tweets This is the Thousand Points of Light George Bush Sr And Trump refer to Disruptive little shocks Like A stroke Let s take a blue pill Disney s new movie Turning Red is disguised as a coming of age tale to push this agenda marketed directly to children The World Economic Forum has stated it s intent for elites to hack humans ending freewill and most recently to have boots on Mars by with the confidence that we will find evidence of civilization there So the Turning Red agenda is to create a serf colony on earth controlled by programmable CBDCs and social credit dust the sky to limit the sun s light install lights that have the ability to switch on and off the ILA genes they edit ending Free will People will be patentable cattle They will have a work mind and a home mind that don t recall what the other did I m not making this up this is all researchable and available info online They are doing this quick If their goal is to send a portion of the upcoming generation to the Red Planet by it s not going to stop This is a false Ascension and in reality there is one timeline active right now The proponents of this movement are attempting to hijack humanity and get to Mars What could be coming that scares the fuck out of them Is it us Let s take a big blue pill get back in the matrix and find out,the Muckraker s Guide To The Fallacy Part,1

Just my personal thought as to how the tragic event of the China Boeing Eastern Flight MU crashed Can t help but think I know that this might sound crazy but not ruling out this a possible scenario that mid air and on a safe cruising altitude the flight crew might have learned that there s a grave threat a virus that is far worst and deadly than COVID is being carried in Flight MU An article written for bloomberg com bloomberg com news articles here s everything we know about the china plane crash so far did not rule out the possibility of a terrorist attack If there is indeed a virus and most likely have already infected everyone in the flight the only course of action the flight crew has is to make sure that the virus does not spread to other cities and to incinerate it thus what we have seen where the plane took a vertical nose dive Again this is just a mere speculation and not in any way claiming that this is what happened as that would be irresponsible and outright disrespectful to the families who are affected by this tragic event There are of course some loop holes if this is a terrorist attack virus Why the authorities did not stop the plane from taking off Why cant the flight crew continue their flight and landed and alerted authorities about the event Praying for healing with the hope that we still find survivors,China Boeing Eastern Flight MU a Possible Virus in the Plane more Deadly than COVID,1

After being bombarded with propaganda for the last years I m getting better at identifying it when I see hear it I was watching tv the other day and a commercial came on for a product called Zocdoc I was doing something so I wasn t looking directly at the tv and was just listening then a very catchy jingle started that sounded to me like get your vax in ation and I thought there s no way that s what it said so rewind the commercial to watch again and when the jingle starts the words get your ducks in a row is written on the screen but it sounds nothing like it Subliminal messages are nothing new and I think commercials are def being used to continue pushing the vax agenda,Subliminal vax message in tv commercial,1

I sometimes wonder if covid was intentionally made to be a weak virus or it was leaked accidentally when they were trying to make something actually more potent and they just decided to roll with it the best they could But then you d think they would have made more dangerous variants Wouldn t they want it to be extremely deadly so they could justify vaccination If they want more people to be vaccinated why didn t they make it more deadly to the point where almost no one survives from it like the Captain Trips virus from The Stand Or did they intentionally make it weak to serve as an experiment for something else,What if Covid was like Captain Trips,1

Well at least she wasn t in front of the counting centers praying to god that he stop the count lol She was probably in bed doing the same thing Another republican caught over playing their hand trying to undue a popular vote and electoral college victory for Biden One of the stupidest conspiracies I have seen is that some states were leaning red during the initial count then went blue and this is evidence of fraud some how So Ohio and Florida went the opposite they were leaning blue then they flipped red by the end of the night I never once considered that the republicans stole those states its simply the nature of how these things are counted Most Trump supporters only started paying attention to elections and politics recently So they don t remember the elections Bush Vs Gore or Kerry Vs Bush Both of these very very close elections swayed towards Bush Trump vs Clinton Trump once again won a close election So these election was stolen conspiracy theorists believe Democrats some how went from losing close elections to being able to flawlessly rig an election whilst still losing house seats Or perhaps it was just a superior get out the vote effort,Virginia Thomas Wife of Clarence Thomas urged White House chief to pursue unrelenting efforts to overturn the election,1

Thoughts,Ukrainian children being brought to Russia a few days before the war began,1
Theory I believe the Russian invasion is as the title says going entirely to plan Russian hasn t had the direct opportunity to try out their weapons against western power since Vietnam they also can test their Armour air craft versus American NLAW s anti tank javelins and fighting vs physical American Mercenaries It s no doubt the USA has put a lot of resources into Ukraine through corrupt deals and what not and Putin saw this as the perfect opportunity to test response times and test out his war machine The reason it is so easy for me to believe this as truth is because the western media has bombarded everyone with propaganda of Ukraine winning as an underdog but the President of Ukraine as a national hero If we look back to world War Two following Joseph Goebbels use of propaganda up until the Allies were right on the very door step of Berlin they continued to pump false information to their own people stating they were winning the war To summarize I ve become so skeptical lately of just about any information coming from the news that I almost believe the opposite of whatever is the stated as truth,Russian invasian Is actually going as planned,1

According to these sites That we keep finding it can all be concluded that they are propaganda demonstrators creating a false war on vaccination and making society seem oppressed when they actually aren t If you aren t buying it yet these demonstrators have been using the tactics of sucking fun and innocence out of the things that we like and trying to make them seem woke or propaganda like when they actually aren t Take the N B A for example two years ago the NBA produced a lot lot of great Black Lives Matter content then the alt right or propaganda bots tried to make this positive sports league and The BLM movement into something bad when both those things are not bad These liars have been created to seperate America and destroy real fun now we are all paranoid sitting on screens while we could have been doing something Good with our lives and speaking even clearer the anti vaccination movement is a complete hoax in every part of it and I m not even shilling Or making this up the people who have had dangerous Side effects from the vaccine are extremely unlucky And vax side effects are rare,The anti vaccine propaganda is false,1

So one thing we speculate is that COVID has basically killed just over million people worldwide with people pointing to that number often in horror now at first glance somebody who s gullible might look at that number and GASP until of course we dig deeper and start using statistics to analyze what million worldwide actually means To first analyze this number we need to verify that these people died solely of COVID and not just with COVID Many skeptics have rightly expressed that dying with the virus is NOT the same as dying from the virus All around the world we ve seen medical establishments inflating the total number of COVID deaths For instance in the UK the main figure being used for COVID deaths is coded as stated on the official Coronavirus website as the number of deaths of people who had had a positive test result for COVID and died within days of the first positive test But we know that a standard PCR test for COVID is terribly inaccurate and skeptics have been saying this since the beginning of the Pandemic Back in March Swiss Policy Research SPR explained that the highly sensitive PCR tests are prone to producing clinically misleading results and that their individual predictive value may easily drop below Even more alarming this means that if a person gets a positive PCR test result at a cycle threshold of or higher as applied in most US labs and many European labs the chance that the person is infectious is less than The chance that the person received a false positive result is or higher Recently the CDC WHO and John Hopkins Institute finally admit that PCR testing for COVID has likely been fraudulent from the get go leading to more conspiracy over the counting of COVID deaths The CDC has recently echoed that it plans to move away from PCR testing html now admitting that the tests produce false positives and bad data and that the test fails to differentiate between influenza and Sars Cov The test is NOT the only testing method used for diagnosing COVID The FDA approved distinct tests for detecting Sars Cov although it has been very WIDELY used since March and most definitely has led to inflating case counts In a video interview mGU from November Dr Anthony Fauci appeared to acknowledge that large numbers of positive COVID cases may arise from oversensitive tests that pick up mere fragments of the virus rather than active viable infections Dr Fauci said this and didn t hold back So I think if somebody does come in with even you got to say you know it s just dead nucleotides period So if anyone raises this discussion as a conspiracy refer them to Dr Fauci With flawed PCR testing another factor in the distorted COVID death count are underlying health conditions and comorbidities accompanying COVID deaths Table htm Comorbidities shows the types of health conditions and contributing causes mentioned in conjunction with deaths involving coronavirus disease COVID From the official CDC website it clearly lists all the comorbidities that accompany COVID deaths in the United States So one interesting fact we find is that COVID is rarely the sole cause of death and most COVID deaths are caused by other conditions then falsely marked down as having solely died from COVID Now we ve established the grim reality that most COVID deaths are actually NOT from COVID leaving everyone wondering how many of them were from the virus So where does that leave us Holistically even if we considered those million dead people as victims of COVID we could do some basic math to gauge that number with percentages The world population can be Googled relatively easily there s no exact estimate but statisticians agree that we had about billion people on earth at the start of The million dead from COVID also pales in comparison with the Spanish flu with a death toll often estimated at million to million victims during a time where the world population was much lower than now at billion people so imagine how much deadlier than COVID the Spanish Flu really was So out of people we ve had deaths from the deadly COVID virus The calculation I m about to preform is an easy one it almost feels like cheating but it s how we can get an overall grasp of numbers we use percentages and ratios to get the big picture Let us divide the number of total COVID deaths by the total world population Covid Deaths Persons Covid Deaths Persons X Now this is really underwhelming we ve been hearing We re in the middle of Global Pandemic for the last years and not even of the World s population has died from it and even with this inflated death count we ve concluded that we are not in a Pandemic and we were never in a Pandemic,Fact Check COVID is deadly because it s killed people worldwide as of March th World Health Organization How the research reveals We were never in a Pandemic,1

There is a bigger psyop going on Bigger than war and inflation Regular military is supposed to be responsible for recruiting They are supposed to avoid recruiting kkk and Nazis at all cost Innocent civilians have moral duties to avoid Nazis but in a protest they don t have to legally avoid Nazis In many countries they can t wave Nazi flags but if somebody else waves flag in a protest others are not responsible But if you read mainstream media it s the opposite it s almost like an alternate universe They claim that instead of holding regular military responsible for recruiting Azov you will be held responsible If one guy is photographed with confederate or Nazi flag in a trucker protest in Canada all of the protesters are Nazi If a Jewish conservative Parliamentarian talks about world economic forum then she is basically siding with Nazi confederates But if regular Ukrainian military funds Nazi groups that s not really bad regular military can be irresponsible with fundings Media is portraying these type of reality But why Because alternate reality doesn t exist like you think it does Alternate reality is metaphysical There is a war on your consciousness Information warfare,The reason regular military is not responsible for funding Nazi Azov but you will be held responsible if one guy waves Nazi flag in a big trucker protest is alternate reality Alternate reality is not what you think it is,1

In recent weeks there have been several stunning revelations concerning the COVID mRNA vaccines and they are being all but ignored by a corporate media eager to change the subject The FDA on Tuesday released a large tranche of Pfizer clinical trials documents in response to a Freedom of Information FOIA request by the Public Health and Medical Professionals for Transparency The documents show that the company knew people were at risk of experiencing more than unique adverse side effects to the mRNA injections Additionally scientists last week revealed that Pfizer s COVID vaccine can enter human liver cells and be converted into DNA something the fact checkers and the U S Centers for Disease Control assured the public could never happen Scientists also recently discovered that a sequence of genetic material patented by Moderna in bears a suspicious similarity to the spike protein in Sars Cov Source https A F Famgreatness com F F F Fcovid vaccine bombshells you probably didnt hear about F,Covid vaccines bombshells your probably missed,1

It is flattering to the Ego to believe we are in on dirty little secrets that others fail to see for themselves Temporarily it may even make you feel better about yourself Ah See I m not an idiot like these people who fell for it But at some point it becomes addictive here we are lurking in the dark of the internet trying to find our next hit of well darkness to satisfy our twisted urges of knowing more and more of the depravity that happens in this world Next thing you know we are running on a mix of high fear anxiety adrenaline superiority from knowing it ahead of all others biting our nails as we are scrolling down We Must Know What Comes Next Predict and Control The weakness of any Mad Scientist And so we keep on following the white rabbit down into wonderland Chasing the next hit of knowledge while we fail to actually do anything about it It gives us a false sense of doing something as knowing is better than not knowing at least we re not sheeps WRONG And slowly but surely they get you In a world where everything is upside down where most of you fell for Qanon and have subconsciously told yourselves NEVER AGAIN they have proceeded to break you and make you one of their front line minions Without saying that you have well lost ANY hope that there are actually good people still working behind the scenes NO NOT AGAIN LIKE QANON WE RE DOOMED OKAY How could such an enlightened and awakened conspiracy theorist as myself potentially be a minion for the elite Glad you asked Unlike many of you the elite knows a thing or two about the Quantum world we live in where the viewer is the creator of reality They also NEED your loosh and your fear to survive They are parasites and are cut off from source thus they must feed off others It doesn t matter if they are feeding off the fear of Aunt Caroll who didn t go out in the past years as she was dead afraid of contracting covid or if it s you being all anxious about WW or the Food Shortages or the next variant disease cyber attack It s just a Prime Rib to a NY striploin different flavors but both will do Actually you serve an even better purpose than Aunt Caroll as you get to be their partners in co creation with your help and your help only they get to generate a lot of manifestation power through all of your beautiful efforts to stay informed Ever heard about predictive programming Of course you do you re a conspiracy theorist To the Elite it doesn t matter if you know most of it you ll just help in their plans You won t do anything about it just generate enough fear and anxiety to lube their machine so they can better fu you in the a It also works in a sense with the universal laws of Free Will they have to let us in on their plans so they don t get punished at higher levels and they play within the rules BUT what they allow you to know is still only the top of the iceberg That s why they have their little wing men like Russel and Alex who can lead the way as to what they can and can t discuss But to most of you s they are going hard with their truth spilling so why not trust them It wouldn t make sense for the elite to spill the beans on their own plan wouldn t it Again Prime Rib or Striploin I know I will sound patronizing and this post may trigger some of you but I really felt compelled to say it I ve been spending less time on here as I came to realize that it is just as toxic as any Covid anxious sub My biggest lesson last year was You can have all the knowledge in the world if you can t open your heart it s not worth SHIT Like legit Nothing at all you re just another unconscious human being who believes is more conscious than another Talk of unconsciousness Oh and all that Gloom and Doom What a way to support the cabal s Armageddon Software If you really want to help it ll take a lot of inner work and a lot of finding God And no God is not religion and these perverted Vatican folks If anything organized religion is the OG conspiracy for control and world domination That s for another post tho Finding the Will of God to make better choices for ourselves our future generations and start to actually take responsibility for ourselves and the legacy we will give this planet Purifying our bodies and souls to be vessels for change Seeing past the dark clouds they don t want you to break free from better just stay in that chaotic doom and gloom is a lot better for the elite as that s where they want you to be Afraid and still under their control You may not realize the amount of power you do hold and the amount of power you are giving them So many of you s are really afraid of these people as if nothing could ever steer the ship away from the dark timeline they want for all of us I mean Klaus looks like a vilan in an Austin Power s movie ffs He speaks like one also Have you seen Joe lately I mean they re playing their roles but is that truly what is standing between us and our greatness Jesus ooops won t mention this one too loudly for the NPC s to be triggered by it and my right wing talk Much love to all of you but I think it s time for us to claim back our power and stop being sheeps for the elite All of your energy and resources could be used for way better things than feeding the same parasitic elite you hate so much,Conspiracy Theorists hate to think of themselves as SHEEPS yet it is just what you are trigger

Is anybody wondering why everything is going to shit In people s personal lives on the world stage and in general it seems the fear machine has been ramped up significantly Nothing was this tough for humanity for a while and maybe that was to make us soft for when the parasites that be unleashed their grand assault or maybe CERN really threw us into a dimension consumed by chaos I feel things will only escalate and ultimately make the holocaust look like a joke A mass harvesting is underway look up Georgia Guidestones and the recycling of souls will be flooding in by the masses The energy these souls provide will keep this Matrix running forever unless we wake up to the fact that this is a quantum prison realm that entities beyond our understanding have taken advantage of and now use us like batteries to feed their agenda The good thing is that over the past decade millions if not billions of us have woken up to the idea that this realm is not real or at least our spiritual identities are not bound to this dimension The Archons are aware of this and are trying their hardest to fuck everything up in our lives so that when we go to the light please try not to the life review we are shown will take a tragic turn and then present another reality where everything is beautiful life works perfectly and we can enjoy another chance in this garden Many of us will want things to be good again and choose to go back The Archontic entities that work for Lucifer are good at persuasion and will go after your primal instincts disguising as loved ones and ascended masters to trick you into coming back when you reach the Bardo between life and death This process can go on for a while as they try to shame you for all you did wrong all that was out of your control Without a D or D consciousness the world we exist in is littered with traps and soul sucking events making it nearly impossible to feel positivite emotions The suppression against these emotions and the proliferation of negativity is their nectar i e loosh their source They have no souls they are jealous and want us to suffer here for eternity We are stronger than they think and are and will break free from this prison planet they created The quantum machine cannot account for human spirit the most valuable asset of the entire cosmos as its connected to source Break the illusion keep your perspectives strong and remember when you see that life review that looks shitty and regretful that it was rigged to begin with I will end with the Jean Luc Picard quote It is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose That is not a weakness that is life Be strong my fellow cosmic beings the grid is breaking apart We will be free,The Archons final attempt,1
Team B and Team are playing football Team B keeps calling out their passing plays before passing they keep calling out their running plays before running Team notices then anticipates and stops the plays Eventually Team B calls a running play but passes the ball for a touchdown Team got fooled into a bad defense by listening to their enemies Strictly listening and believing your enemies allows them easier access to control what you think feel and do Your enemy will gladly take advantage of this to lead you down a path that only makes things easier for them to defeat you Guy B and Guy are friendly while working together Guy B keeps bringing up the local news stories about a rapist targeting women alone in parks Guy doesn t ever say anything about the news stories he doesn t even acknowledge that Guy B brings them up Guy B ignores the silence and the two eventually become good friends even outside of work Guy is hiding his support for the rapist through his silence Guy thinks that a woman shouldn t go anywhere in public without a male escort Guy thinks that these women deserved to get raped for sexually tempting a man by being alone in public Ignoring peoples silence on specific topics means you will eventually become friends with a monster Monsters will gladly take advantage of you ignoring their silence to hide their most heinous thoughts and feelings There are plenty of people that I see being praised for the minuscule amount they do say while everybody ignores what they stay silent on If there is a conspiracy that you fully believe is true something you feel has proof available something you expend a lot of energy on exposing stopping and people in power consistently stay silent on the issue well then FUCK THEM Were at a point in the world where the silence I hear is more deafening than any words that could possibly be spoken There are some things that you can t stay silent on any more On a few key subjects silence is almost equal to stating your to explicit direct support sometimes it s even worse because ignoring that silence only allows the evil to hide closer to you TLDR Your enemies will gladly take advantage of you listening to them They will gladly lie to you and guide you down a path that s least likely to lead to their defeat If you listen to your enemies and don t expend more time and energy to prove they aren t lying to you then they can easily control what you think is true Monsters are continuously hiding in plain sight They take advantage of you ignoring their silence and will gladly feed you little bits here and there to get you on their side and fighting for them Still TLDR The conspiracy you feel is most easily provable and most hurtful to the world fuck anybody in power who isn t just as adamantly outspoken about that conspiracy as you They are a wolf in sheeps clothing hiding behind their silence Don t accept their silence anymore,Silence speaks louder than words Listen to your enemies and they control what you think Ignore your friends silence and you become friends with monsters Pay more attention to the silence of your friends it s become deafening How can nobody else notice this,1

Reddit has been completely taken over by corporate interests if you can t already tell Bot accounts of increasing sophistication and lies are spreading the most emotionally disturbing content AI can think up They have a machine that can manipulate us all into negativity The AI learns how to kill people Am I the only one I see on here Maybe the real Reddit was blocked from me Women are getting paid to pretend they are available with account names that try to steal my vibe and subreddits with women I m interested in have all been hacked from me This is all from them thinking I might be gay or something from my twin brother fraternal that actually is out as gay They try to make me simp to take advantage of me They are disrespectful and think getting attention from women on here is a game Getting attention like I was is not normal even INCELS who complain about not getting laid would get hacked from the women if there was a way to meet them People don t know what simp is like me They want to try to make me a sub or beta male because I randomly talked to a fetish artist They think someone can be bitch made literally taking someone s manhood The fact is that I m not gay and people are trying to turn someone minding their business into a sex fight It looks like they even kill people to try to be dominant like humans are just people at war over checking out women on Reddit Women have said they were afraid to post I continue to tell people that I m straight and to stop trying to change my sexuality and they continue to do sex assault and ignore my wishes for how I want to live People don t even know what gay is in the first place because I m old enough to know who I am and they are wasting their time They just cause me extreme pain and distress People have tried to change peoples sexuality for probably forever on earth This is from one man being attractive So it helps to interact online with my autism so people are killing people stealing my personality They know the women help me infinitely and want to try to hide that and change my sexuality I know everything about it and so they are torturing me for no reason because I would be with men right now if I really was gay Peoples lives are on the line because people who don t use Reddit want to create that they are hot or something on here Let s not forget they copy and redistribute my every invention and innovation My life is insanely wonderful besides outside people who are hacking right now These people are trying to steal a person s life and every person who uses Reddit They don t even know what Reddit is It is worth money obviously and it s like a free carnival of manipulation at this point Psychologically it makes sense from me being so confident other men are afraid and want to break my mind impose dominance like this is the Holocaust or something You can tell martial arts people are involved by the tactics they use I was not posting on Reddit for a while to protest the political game They don t want me to think I could have a girlfriend to stop my neurochemicals,Reddit takeover,1
The Military Industrial Complex has made billions since the Russian invasion Lockheed Martin Raytheon Northrop BAE et al have seen their shares go fly high amidst a slump in market values following the Russia invasion on February th for more details see Asia Times Largest Military Budget in US History In the immediate wake of Russia s invasion the US Congress approved on behalf of defense contractors private mercenary companies et al the largest ever defense spending bill in US history while U S allies in Europe pledged to dramatically ramp up their defense spending to counter the Russian threat measures that will bring lucrative new contracts to the arms industry The Hill emphasis added Did the defense giants have foreknowledge of the Russian attack A month prior to the invasion top western arms companies were briefing investors about a likely boost to their profits Gregory J Hayes the chief executive of US defense giant Raytheon stated on a January Raytheon and Lockheed Martin are openly telling their investors that tensions between the countries are good for business Let us be under no illusions A World War III scenario involving the use of nuclear weapons directed against Russia and China as well as against several non nuclear states has been on the drawing board of the Pentagon for more than years And America s major defense contractors which produce the nukes are increasingly involved in strategic decisions pertaining to their use as well as the formulation of US nuclear military doctrine There is a powerful faction within the Deep State which considers that a nuclear is winnable And winnable WWIII scenarios and simulations most of them classified are routinely contemplated Post Nuclear Doctrine The Cold War Goes Hot under G W B A dangerous shift in US nuclear doctrine occurred in under the Bush administration In early the text of George W Bush s Nuclear Posture Review had already been leaked several months prior to the release of the September National Security Strategy NSS which defined Preemption as the anticipatory use of force in the face of an imminent attack The Doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction MAD of the Cold War Era was scrapped and replaced with the Doctrine of Preemptive Nuclear War PNW namely the peacemaking use of nuclear weapons as a means of self defense against both nuclear and non nuclear weapons states One thing was replaced by its opposite MAD is real PNW is fake There is no such thing as a peace making use of nuclear weapons Secret Meeting on Hiroshima Day Setting the Stage for The Privatization of Nuclear War A year later on August on Hiroshima Day a secret meeting was held behind closed doors at Strategic Command Headquarters at the Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska Senior executives from the nuclear industry and the military industrial complex were in attendance This mingling of defense contractors scientists and policy makers was not intended to commemorate Hiroshima The meeting was intended to set the stage for the development of a new generation of smaller safer and more usable nuclear weapons to be used in the in theater nuclear wars of the st Century Michel Chossudovsky August This meeting was instrumental in setting the stage for the privatization of nuclear war leading up to Obama s trillion dollar nuclear weapons program which is now slated to increase to trillion by Diplomacy is scrapped in favor of Big Money The privatization of both conventional and nuclear war is the driving force behind the crisis in Ukraine coupled with the influx of foreign mercenaries recruited by private companies on contract to the Pentagon and NATO While Biden is officially against the use of nukes on a first strike basis the lobby groups acting on behalf of the defence giants are calling the shots Nuclear War Is Good for Business But It Requires a Human Face and a Peace Making Mandate The Defense Giants are pushing the preemptive nuclear war doctrine with Russia allegedly as a means of self defence and national security for America and its allies And the media applauds Public acceptance of WMDs is predicated on a public relations campaign which posits that mini nukes as humanitarian bombs The peacemaking use of nuclear weapons missiles and fighter jets is being used as a marketing strategy on behalf of Lockheed Martin Raytheon Northrupp Grumman BAE et al The latest state of the art B mini nuke the more usable low yield nuclear weapons is a portrayed as a humanitarian bomb harmless to civilians because the explosion is underground The B peace making bomb has a maximum yield of kilotons which is more than three times that of a Hiroshima bomb kilotons which resulted in excess of deaths in matter of minutes Humanitarian Preemptive Nukes are part of a dangerous ideology as well as a marketing strategy on behalf of the defense giants The unspoken reality of a nuclear war is Mutual Assured Destruction MAD and the End of Humanity as we know it,The Privatization of Nuclear War,1
Ss language is important I just thought of this They call it a vaccine because we know what a vaccine does or is supposed to do in reality this vaccine resembles gene therapy more than it does vaccination What if they use the word vaccine because they fear if they called it what it was less people would take it Like having a cake made of bull testicles and still calling it a cake,Language in the words of the late great George Carlin Ask yourself why they call it a vaccine and not a gene therapy like it is,1

Fellow Large Brained Mammals I m attempting to wake up my woke friends They always call me a conspiracy theorist but then sure as shit some of them end up coming true and they usually just write it off With that said I could use some help finding information on validated conspiracy theories what I mean by this is something that was a conspiracy theory but now is widely accepted by most people For example the moon landing wouldn t count because no major media source has validated it yet even though there is enough supporting evidence Some examples top of mind that I can think of would be COVID coming from Wuhan the existence of UFOs and Epstein s death involving foul play Can someone please point me in the right direction,Request for Validated Conspiracies,1

PSA this is not a bash against Christians or religions not anti christ piece or anything So stay with me here I ve been going down a rabbit hole of the conjuring Annabelle movies the history behind each how each lines up and rewatching each one And there are a few occurring themes in each For example in every movie both in the Annabelle and conjuring franchise there s some kind of demonic spirit or entity or person conjuring trying to posses or kill someone and they are defeated or banished somehow using a sort of catholic Christian symbol Holy water holy grail crosses priests exorcism etc they are afraid of these things or hate them or embody the opposite of them when terrorizing such as turning the crosses upside down The other theme is exactly the last part that in every movie they must defeat this evil by a usage of a catholic method And the evil often tests their faith in these movies With Annabelle creation it weakness of faith stirs trouble in the Nun it covers it self with the appearance of a Nun to deceive people Either way the antagonist is always demonic and the protagonist victims are always religious In every movie thus far Now I know what you re thinking these are movies of course Hollywood pushes agendas in movies But keep this in mind and this is wear the theory comes in these movies are all based on true stories Now this is a conspiracy Reddit so I don t expect their to be much comments about whether the story is real or not Moving on these movies are all based on accounts of true people in almost every story involving the Warrens couple and some sort of family or person they helped or encountered Please mind where these movies all take place The Nun chronologically is the first movie and the first encounter or moment in history taking place in the s Romania to be exact the same year in real life that Ed and Lorraine Warren open the New England Society for Psychic Research NESPR This is a crucial time period This is a decade after the Cult scare of the s Also several years after the end of World War Two Think about it critically what would ve been running through people s minds at that point THE END OF THE WORLD The apocalypse The deadly end that is discussed in the Bible Now a good Christian is taught to turn as many as possible to the gospel To the Lord To be a prophet of the Lord This is Ed and Lorraine Warren This couple saw what they believe to be the end of the world happening right in front of them People were worshiping the devil in groups God s children in all areas of God s earth were fighting they believe the end was near Not to mention Ed Warren actually fought in WW and almost died there And they needed to save as many souls as possible How would they do this Well make them believe that evil demonic spirits are out to get their and their children s soul unless they turn to God I don t know about you But this sounds like a pretty effective method especially in the s s was this kind of scare would ve been entertaining the s in particular for its cult craze on the media With so many people fascinated with the idea of the supernatural using it but it a horrific way as it did would turn people to God Imagine a reading a story about a family of who moves onto this kind of secluded land that is legended bc remember these are apparently are all actual folklore based upon thousands of years to be haunted by a woman who was rumored to practice witch craft and was said to sacrifice her own child All of a sudden the mother starts getting random bruises on her the family dog dies the girls are taunted in their sleep and boom the mother is getting possessed and their lives are in danger but what do they do Well they call in a couple priests and a couple who of course specializes in spirits and happen to be devout Roman Catholics Together these forces BANISH the unholy demonic spirit and frees the family of their nightmare Of course this story is written by one of the family members themselves the daughter She writes all about how the Warrens but really The power of GOD saved their family What does sister Charlotte in Annabelle Creatin say the only way a soul can be weak Is if it s faith is weak What happens to a weak soul It gets inhabited by the devil even though it s no Satan it s malthus In the Nun the priests hear of a problem with one of their Nun chapels what do they do They send a expert priest and a nun in training to go check out the problems to evaluate of backup if needed Backup apparently being an army of Catholics warriors ready to take on any unholy place On the flip side of that what causes the evil to start attacking the victims of Annabelle Well of course a desperate husband and wife allow a demonic spirit to take inhabitance in their home and latch onto a doll that will go on to possess a disable child kill four people try to murder a baby and eventually trick a teenage girl it is her dead father and will unleash other unholy spirits to terrorize three girls In the The Devil made me do it case which happened to be the BIGGEST of the Warren career a man pleaded not guilty by reason of the devil This all led back to a man having a baby out of wedlock and that baby growing up to be interested in cults ultimately joining one causing the death of innocent people and trying to posses the body of a child then a year old boy In some stories these people are unlucky victims of unholy spirits in other stories people turned away from God and turned to the devil which caused horrible repercussions Either way the way out of the problem always was GOD Roman Catholicism is the way Repent and turn to God This is literally the message of every Warren encounter Someone s comment explain the museum of haunted things Ed Warren was a painter proving he was creative who s to say he didn t create these things himself or better yet they brought these things from stores garage sells etc They created these out of this world stories about evil being defeated by the power of God that so many found interesting But how many of them also believed it and did just that repented and Turned to God after Why the movies after years Because as I mentioned early Hollywood has an agenda too Who s to not say the creators aren t devout Roman Catholics who feels like the world is coming to an end so in the writers call Mrs Warren and friends the families that believe in their message to help spread their gospel once again Please discuss in comments I really wanna know what y all think,The Conjureverse was a tactic by the Warrens to turn the public to God,1

There are probably more ways but they will all revolve around you You have to start with yourself understand yourself and your biases which could impede on you getting to the truth There s a lot of things that you won t want to acknowledge or be unable to see at the beginning There s this one thing on which if you focus on and be true to yourself you can understand how this world works It s the Ego and fun and if you understand it you will see that they are one and the same It s an energy of zero sum meaning you get as much as someone else loses Gaining this energy is fun positive emotion losing is the opposite negative emotion you are having fun on someone s expense you laugh as much as someone else gets mad for an example That is the very basic which many will not want to see or understand for variety of reasons usually them seeing themselves as the good guys and that fun just can t be bad it s their enjoyment after all Even if you can t trace or explain it to yourself where or from who the fun is coming from be sure that it has it s cost could be electrical energy environmental damage animals wasting the energy money time of other s gt food gt sun energy etc You will have to understand the wider aspect of what Ego is expand the meaning of it how it grows on the expense of others again fun how it correlates with money materialism and eventually the animality of a person Everything in live has its price and the soul has to pay for it To understand it and the balance of this world you can t think of it in a matter of one lifetime and there s enough variety in this world to experience both hell and heaven if you want to think of it this way There s a lot as people and their Egos get more complex but the basics remain simple as you yourself will find out while you unravel them Your own Ego will stand in your way to the truth in many things and getting rid of it is like going through purgatory because in its essence it s the opposite of the ultimate truth and the God a realization probably way down the road I m not religious and you don t need religion and definitely not a one with an animal ego beast like hierarchy and materialism money involved anywhere everything you need you will find within yourself as long as you are true to yourself and keep up high morality I guess this is it for now the inspiration to write something comes and goes so does energy I don t thing the world is heading in the right direction majority seems to be willing to sell out and believe what s convenient and doesn t get in their way of having fun in life I have a very little hope left for humanity The good guys are not winning and I m not really sure they are able to as winning grows Ego maybe creating a better world where there s no such animal like competition that would take people with generally higher morality and understanding of why they put the truth to the winners their own animality ego We know which country is all about winning and winners ego and materialism which also currently leads the world not only with power but information and messaging and if there is any good and evil they aren t even hiding it everything means the opposite and they are the good guys celebrating Sa n ta n the lord of materialism Ego and beast animality on the day Christ was supposedly murdered,How you can find God or the truth practically,1

Like many I find the enormous attention to the war in Ukraine unusual It appears the stage is being set for something bigger I m not pro Russia I m not anti Ukraine What I m trying to figure out is why so many people think this war is so horrendous in contrast to others that we are now hurting ourselves through sanctions while any other war is just business as usual Is there something less justifiable about this war I see smart people applauding sanctions to our own detriment People calling for us to do more and join the fight I live in Canada But again why this war Don t get me wrong I understand some people are just blindly reacting to the media without question I want to be able to show some of these people that in fact that s exactly what they re doing by drawing paralells between this invasion and others I m familiar with some but am no expert on the matter I dispise the whole idea of war But Scrutinizing what we re being told about this war or Russia s potential motive is not the same as justifying what Russia is doing People are acting like it is and I d like to ask these people if they thought we should have acted accordingly with other invasions in recent history What are some invasions that have happend this millennium whether you thought they were justified or not,How many invasions have happend this Millenium,1

This is not a pro Putin or pro Ukraine post This is a warning that a draft may be issued in the US if some sort of attack is played out against American troops infrastructure or American land If the American people do not resist a potential mandated war much our country and the world could be in serious jeopardy If an attack is to happen on American entity do not be whipped up into a frenzy against whoever the state is demonizing A full scale war between superpowers will be devastating to America the west and the rest of the world It will be terrible if we win or not Nothing positive can come about it for the American people Keep in mind how the US has involved itself into most wars since the th century An attack that is not given proper honest investigation is used as a battlecry for the American people to send their sons to die Sinking of the USS Maine Spanish American War Sinking of the Lusitania WW Pearl Harbor WW Gulf of Tonkin Vietnam War on Terror various invasions in the middle east There are several more incendents where a domestic attack is used to crack down on free speech or various US citizen rights Although another world War is most likely going to involve many countries the US could be the deciding factor on whether the countries commit mutual destruction Although it may seem like it the people still have a voice despite what ever the international military industrial complex chooses to do,We need to organize mass disobedience in the case of a draft,1
I think we are all familiar with what comfort zone is you know that thing that stops you from improving your life taking a job opportunity that is better for you but demands some personal sacrifice moving to another city or country when things are going fine where you are but could be better elsewhere It s perfectly normal and it s our ego doing what it does best keeping us where we know it s safe we can get food and money Don t forget we are still animals and we re hopefully always be Now the problem with the ego is that we have a natural tendency of allowing it to grow more and more powerful and influential which causes us to limit our growth I believe this is the primary reason why this sub never gets banned why TV shows such as Ancient Aliens are allowed to question the narrative why even when we show our friends and relatives the truth about vaccines NWO they may believe what you re saying and agree with you that there are so many lies the MSM keeps spreading Now you tell me how many millions perhaps billions of people in the world have been exposed to these facts How many billions of people are aware of the existence of a spiritual world How many have seen UFOs and are sure aliens are real or at least agree that a part of our history has several strange chapters that can t be explained by mainstream archaeology I tell you nearly everyone has at least one certainty that should be life changing Or they don t really believe it because certain authorities haven t confirmed it Because to most alien believers aliens are not a fact until NASA confirms them but why do you need a government agency to confirm something you know for a fact Or you know those Covid vaccines are fishy but you won t do anything and will still take the shots despite the evidence is out there why Are you waiting for WHO to say that for you The same goes for spirituality You say it s real you ve actually seen and felt things you ve witnessed the power of meditation but then none of that is real until mainstream physicists say so If you re waiting for mainstream science to confirm God don t hold your breath And there s this sub and the same is valid for any conspiracy channels out there that has been around for years uncensored I mean more than a million people on this sub alone are being exposed to information that should break some existing paradigm in their lives I m sure those of us that are truly red pilled have made some changes such as not taking the vaccine or not watching MSM maybe some people went further escaped big cities and are growing potatoes But how many haven t changed an inch Knowing for a fact all of the things we know we all have this moral obligation to do something but we instead stay silent or all we do is share some of the great content here with people close to us we can trust and our lifestyle is very often unchanged What are we doing with all this information and knowledge Where s the so dreamed Resistance against the evil TPTB I know many of us trusted Qanon would do it for us but isn t that what Comfort Zone looks like Let others do the thing while we watch from home What else does it take so we finally realize we live in a tridimensional matrix controlled by an elite that adores evil multidimensional entities I mean truly realize and do something about it Not to mention all the mind blowing things you learn when you research ancient civilizations Monolithic structures around the world are strangely aligned with each other and with constellations anachronic artifacts that challenge mainstream history Also the bizarre facts about the Moon and Mars Shouldn t all this turn our world upside down Are we truly aware of how strange this world is This is what the movie Don t Look Up is about It s exactly what we do Know things but ignore them because it s too much to grasp and the truth is none of us want to do anything about anything at all good news it only takes one of us to make the kick off,The comfort zone conspiracy,1

A few months ago I found what seemed like the pages to some old conspiracy theory magazine from the s They speak of things like new world order cultural disintegration and other such bizarre concepts Although not taking it seriously I was intrigued by one particular interview where two men discussed the consequences of multiculturalism They speak of a controversial statue at the United Nations Head quarters called the United Nations Brown Man Here is the passage Q Are you familiar with the concept of the United Nation s Brown Man that they have There s a statue at the United Nations headquarters in New York City No I haven t heard of that You ll have to enlighten me Q It s a faceless statue with a faceless woman and two faceless children standing beside him The inscription reads to paraphrase it The United Nations Brown Man the man of the future nationless raceless cultureless see full passage in image attached I returned to this just recently to recall the name of the statue they were referring to since I could not find any results when searching from memory Unfortunately I cannot even find results when using this text word for word There appears to be no record of a United Nations Brown Man or even the quote that they attributed to Nietzsche Could everything in this article be fabricated or is it possible that the information has been removed Note I am new to reddit and did not know the best community to post this question Please let me know if there is a better place to discuss this,Has anyone heard of the United Nations Brown Man,1

Everyone and their dog are lining up to help Ukraine and supporting them fb banners and fundraisers etc but when it came to helping Syria a huge amount of people didn t want them to come into Canada as refugees or offer their homes with open arms or provide as much online support for it Why Because they re brown that s why No one has given me any kind of answer other than that I m appalled about how much suffering has happened to Syrian families yes Ukraine is the one on fire right now and it s a tragic state of affairs but we need to stop playing favourites on a global scale Somalia Congo Iraq Afghanistan and Yemen are all at war right now Why do we not hear about any of that Because it s not good news The conspiracy is that our government and msm are indoctrinating white supremacy by literally ignoring the pleas from these people because somewhere deep down they believe them to be inferior due to melanin production Any one else feeling this War is dumb all around,the west is racist and the Ukraine support shows that,1
We are seeing a classic gaslight effort in real time The moment the elites lost control of inflation which ultimately could lead to mass unrest and political uprising the first European War since WWII starts Beyond the obvious increase to Oil Prices which we could have avoided with a strong domestic energy policy now the Biden Admin is talking about Food Shortages and blaming Putin s War I get it Ukraine is a big exporter of Wheats and Grains but how much of what Americans eat come from Ukraine Shocking not little to none I can t help but wonder how coordinated this all may be I have a lot of respect for the total control the elites have managed to secure over all facets of life I may not agree with it I Don t but the fact that they ve achieved this is remarkable perhaps not as remarkable as I may believe if it s something that has been going on since the dawn of Man but surely they can t assume we are this stupid Maybe they ve overly discounted the Information Age Maybe the are now scrambling with erratic attempt after erratic attempt How can we start to understand their M O without understanding their expectations of us Share your thoughts,Are we expected to believe this,1

SS Most people don t realize how far in advance U S government think tank strategists plan In the background they ve been working for many years to instigate a war between Russia and Ukraine They finally succeeded and that war is good news for U S financial interests as it temporarily stops the increasing friendship with Russia and the rest of Europe not to mention costing them all a fortune Do you recall the bailout of the Remember how not just the banks were bailed out but there were two other U S industries that received huge amounts of money at that time Medical and pharmaceutical companies Why they were never in danger of failing Because enter Covid to exit Western Society s free speech Now look at Brexit Why Because as far as most of the European Union nations are concerned Russia is more important than the United States Why Russia s natural resources are worth more to the EU than the United States So our friends England have willingly re positioned to remain staunchly aligned to the United States in the coming years Meanwhile the European Union will eventually see Russia entering that group Russia would already be in the EU were it not for the influence of the United States and England And Europe certainly doesn t want Russia aligned with China Now that our best friend England has left that group the writing is on the wall for Russia to eventually replace them as needed money and muscle years tops Meanwhile Ukraine will soon fall to the Russians This is not a vote in favor of what Russia did just an observation Peace will come quickly when an armistice is declared The price of getting that armistice to stop the invasion will be a pro Russian government running Ukraine Recap The United States covertly encouraged Russian confidence they could attack Ukraine and get away with it This delays Russia s budding friendship with the EU and caused financial havoc for them too It will buy us a decade more time to find other ways to rule the world as all the English speaking first language countries start banding together a little tighter because of the meteoric rise of China and India And the true reason for Brexit is that England is squarely no longer thinking that the EU is of first importance and its fortunes will increasingly be very married to the United States and the other English speaking countries it spawned It s not that they won t be friends with all of Europe They will It s that they stay best friends with the United States not France or Germany neither of which the United States can count on,Europe Will Completely Morph in the Next Two Decades,1

At this point it seems obvious that the end goal is depopulation Almost all the elites are eugenicists who say the world is overpopulated and that we need to cut CO emissions as much as possible They are currently engineering a food crisis an energy crisis and a hyper inflationary collapse of the global financial system It s on record that Covid was artificially created and everyone with a brain know it was intentionally released The vaccine is extremely experimental being the first and only available MRNA vaccine in history and took less than a year to create and test and become available to the public Safe and proven drugs like Ivermectin were blocked while dangerous drugs like Remdesivir which causes kidney failure were pushed onto people Fertility rates and sperm counts have fallen off of a cliff due to all the micro plastics chemical in everything Our food is poisoned the water is poisoned our skies are poisoned Everything TPTB have done over the past decades have been to slowly make us sick and infertile because that s their goal They stole the world through fraud and they want you off their property They have consolidated enough wealth and power so now they are making their move You are the carbon they want to eliminate If someone goes up to you an says they are going to punch you in the face and then pull their arm back you should assume they are going to punch you in the face and avoid the attack The globalists have said there are too many people and they are trying to do change that so unless we do something about it much of the world will be depopulated,Is there any possible way this doesn t end in depopulation,1
I guess this could be an argument to use against the naive Of course they ll probably just plug their ears and scream or claim there s no evidence that ivermectin HCQ nutrition or immunity is effective against covid Because the information streams they use are propaganda that censor truth When you trust the governments and corporations in regards to the covid narrative and vax safety remember they re responsible for working together with their media monopoly to ensure there were almost no early treatments available before the vax demonizing ivermectin and HCQ or widespread information about consuming immune system supporting nutrients like zinc C D selenium folate Quercetin etc Information and treatments were purposely withheld that would have saved a massive amount of lives mostly because they couldn t profit off of those aspects and also wanted more people dying initially to increase the legitimacy and fear of the pandemic they wanted to take advantage of If they cared about saving lives they would have at the very least had their media spamming the public to lose weight and eat certain immune system supporting nutrients that were proven to drastically reduce chances of death instead of acting like the shots were the savior that if we re not lying to ourselves know it was far from Just knowing these things took place makes it obvious to anyone not living in denial that it was never about health safety saving lives,How can people still trust governments corporations and their media after the covid redpilling Must be denial over fear that they were fooled into taking a big risk,1
Before the late th century in the US breakfast didn t have any particular importance ascribed to it But all that was changed by a small group of religious fanatics and lobbyists for cereal and bacon companies Breakfast cereals got their start at sanatoriums founded by followers of the newly formed Seventh day Adventist religion These religious health gurus opened sanatoriums and introduced people to vegetarian diets and eating bland whole wheat as a way to counter ill health The first cereal invented by James Caleb Jackson and the better known Kellogg s brand invented by John Harvey Kellogg were both born at sanatoriums Jackson was a preacher and Kellogg a religious man who believed that masturbation was the greatest evil which bland healthy foods like corn flakes could prevent Both Jackson and Kellogg were early Seventh day Adventists further tying a sense of religious morality into their ideas around the importance of healthy eating The cliche that breakfast is the most important meal and one with very specific food groups developed from those early days of cereal,Breakfast as we know is started in sanatoriums,1

I m not trolling and I fully respect everyone s beliefs but I ve always been curious about something regarding covid vaccine conspiracy theories Specifically what would be the motive behind adding things to the vaccine to kill people e g graphene oxide live covid virus chemicals to cause heart failure etc It seems counterproductive for the government or pharma companies to kill their consumers since they d lose money Same with the microchips seems like a lot of effort to track people given that of people carry a phone on them which is already definitely used by the government to track them I m not saying the government doesn t do bad things they obviously do have but I m just wondering what you guys think the motive for this stuff would be I agree that big pharma companies are making a fortune off of covid but it wouldn t make much sense for them to add anything toxic to the vaccines to kill off people that they could be making millions off of Again I m not shitting on anyone s opinion and this isn t bait I m genuinely curious to hear what you guys think,A genuine question,1

Hey all Hope you re well I read TK s manifesto late last year and it happened to connect with a lot of the reading I ve been doing over the last several years Based on that plus all the stuff we know from the communal effort here it seemed clear to me that he saw at least in part the types of things we ve been experiencing ever since that darn wet market caused a pandemic On Leftism gt The two psychological tendencies that underlie modern leftism we call feelings of inferiority and oversocialization Feelings of inferiority are characteristic of modern leftism as a whole while oversocialization is characteristic only of a certain segment of modern leftism but this segment is highly influential gt gt Many leftists have an intense identification with the problems of groups that have an image of being weak women defeated American Indians repellent homosexuals or otherwise inferior The leftists themselves feel that these groups are inferior They would never admit to themselves that they have such feelings but it is precisely because they do see these groups as inferior that they identify with their problems We do not mean to suggest that women Indians etc ARE inferior we are only making a point about leftist psychology On Social Control and Its Harms gt for most people it is through the power process having a goal making an AUTONOMOUS effort and attaining the goal that self esteem self confidence and a sense of power are acquired When one does not have adequate opportunity to go through the power process the consequences are depending on the individual and on the way the power process is disrupted boredom demoralization low self esteem inferiority feelings defeatism depression anxiety guilt frustration hostility spouse or child abuse insatiable hedonism abnormal sexual behavior sleep disorders eating disorders etc gt gt Imagine a society that subjects people to conditions that make them terribly unhappy then gives them drugs to take away their unhappiness Science fiction gt gt To start with there are the techniques of surveillance Hidden video cameras are now used in most stores and in many other places computers are used to collect and process vast amounts of information about individuals Information so obtained greatly increases the effectiveness of physical coercion i e law enforcement Then there are the methods of propaganda for which the mass communication media provide effective vehicles Efficient techniques have been developed for winning elections selling products influencing public opinion The entertainment industry serves as an important psychological tool of the system possibly even when it is dishing out large amounts of sex and violence amp xB Obviously there s more I m not sure if everyone is of the same opinion as me but I wrote a book about this manifesto and how its predictions have fared with a great deal of new thinking based on my readings and research The short story is I think he was prescient on many matters but he was motivated by hatred or desperation and went about things all wrong I geared the book towards a general population and although I mention early treatments for COVID I don t go into vaccines since that s so touchy Perhaps it will be useful if you have people in your life that need something that s well referenced and all in one place I have it for free on my website pdf and for on Kindle I didn t pull any punches There are a lot of conspiracies in here including a five decade long one still impacting children that can t be posted on this sub Have been getting good feedback so far for the most part Cheers Would love to hear what you think about the topic in general,Did Ted Kaczynski predict the Great Reset,1

Saint Ignatius of Loyola was a Spanish Catholic priest and theologian who with Peter Faber and Francis Xavier founded the religious order of the Society of Jesus The Jesuits and became the first Superior General of the Society of Jesus in Paris in He envisioned the purpose of the Society of Jesus to be missionary work and teaching Unlike members of other religious orders in the church who take the vows of chastity obedience and poverty members of the society Jesuits also take a fourth vow of obedience to the Pope to engage in projects ordained by the pontiff Jesuits were instrumental in leading the Counter Reformation As a former soldier Ignatius paid particular attention to the spiritual formation of his recruits and recorded his method in the Spiritual Exercises In time the method has become known as Ignatian spirituality He joined the army at seventeen and according to one biographer he strutted about with his cape flying open to reveal his tight fitting hose and boots a sword and dagger at his waist page needed According to another he was a fancy dresser an expert dancer a womanizer sensitive to insult and a rough punkish swordsman who used his privileged status to escape prosecution for violent crimes committed with his priest brother at carnival time With the assistance of his personal secretary Juan Alfonso de Polanco Ignatius wrote the Jesuit Constitutions which were adopted in They created a centralised organisation of the order and stressed absolute self denial and obedience to the Pope and to superiors in the Church hierarchy This was summarised in the motto perinde ac cadaver as if a dead body meaning that a Jesuit should be as emptied of ego as is a corpse However the overarching Jesuit principle became Ad maiorem Dei gloriam for the greater glory of God,Catholicism the worst thing to ever happen to Earth,1

Given the fact the democratic party is largely more hostile to fossil fuels in the long run vested interests have a massive incentive to make sure a republican is president Lobbyist groups or straight up bribery would be one way to help these efforts but what s less incriminating and maybe even more effective is to lean on the scales where gas prices are set Drive prices higher under democratic presidents and hit the populace right in their wallets encouraging them to elect a republican next time Keep prices lower under republicans for the same reason Where do the vested interests have the ability to tip the scales Start by looking at the disconnect between gas prices and crude,Gas prices are influenced to boost republican presidents candidates,1

C span is reporting shortage on semi conductor that results the shorts on cars and other supply chains For those who s in the industry could I confirm the shortage is due to ABF Acrylic resin which is largely provided by Ajinomoto in Japan In general Japanese is famous for their honest and royalty Is it possible that they are so unhappy with the current US admin that they reject to further cooperate As far as Russia who just confirmed they will ban short selling which may very well be the original reasoning that position the conflict interest for ruling class of America that resulted this war between Ukraine and Russian The best supporting is there s no material fight between Russia and Ukraine except the fact of American sending the aide by tax payer s money Overlap all those it seems to be American is losing control of the world order which was built after ww Considering the deep corruption on foreign influence via money above and more such as ccp maybe we are looking at a falling system where America can only relies on Americans,Shortage on semi conductor and many others,1

As the US fades from international affairs this document first lays out the historical backdrop of the US financial system and how the US is setting up its own economic downfall It predicts Russian Ruble recovery via Russia witholding fertilizer from the US and thus taking over the ethanol market by way of their wheat and corn surplus Then the document then explains how a formula involving China Germany Russia Ukraine and the Democratic Republic of Congo DRC could orchestrate a peace plan in which Russia would be allowed to mine cobalt in the Congo in exchange for Russia providing military support to the DRC and allowing the DRC president Felix Tshisekedi to mediate for peace on the Russia Ukraine crisis China would continue to develop infrastructure in the Congo while Germany would provide to the DRC arms purchased from Ukraine in exchange for building a dam to develop green hydrogen with the option of purchasing cobalt directly from either Chinese or Russian mining companies in the Congo The Congo has of the world s cobalt supply which is the most critical element in lithium batteries as it keeps them from overheating and catching fire If Russia gains access to the cobalt reserves in the Congo they will have some influence on China s lithium battery exports and thus the defense capabilities of most nations since the vast majority of modern military equipment is reliant on battery powered electricity At the moment China has most of the influence in this regard as the top lithium battery and lithium hydroxide exporter If the Congo offers to the Russians access to its cobalt reserves Russia will have similar leverage against the west that China has and this will most likely compel more western nations to be just as careful with Russia as they are with China as to not upset the economic arrangement These dependencies seem to be the only deterrent to major wars breaking out Fall of the US Dollar Expansion of the Euro Recovery of the Russian Ruble and Congolese intervention in the Ukraine Russo conflict cgi tgt https A F Fwww academia edu F FThe Fall of the US Dollar Expansion of the Euro Recovery of the Russian Ruble and Congolese intervention in the Ukraine Russo conflict amp id amp blog,The Congolese President could bring peace to Ukraine and Russia by offering Russia access to the Congo s cobalt reserves in exchange for Russia providing military support to the Congo and also allowing Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi to mediate for peace on the Russia Ukraine crisis,1

The US has been involved in testing experimental drugs on volunteers from the ranks of the Ukrainian military commander of Russian Nuclear Biological and Chemical Protection Forces Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov said during a media briefing on Thursday We continue to publish information about the research with the participation of Ukrainian military personnel I would like to note that such work is prohibited in the United States and is carried out by the military outside of the country the official stated The experimental drug testing came within the so called UP project exposed by the Russian military earlier this month According to data published in the Bulgarian media about Ukrainian soldiers died during the experiments in the Kharkov laboratory alone and another were hospitalized Kirillov stated adding that more than four thousand people were involved in the testing in Ukraine The official presented a document purportedly sent by a Ukrainian military attach in the US to the country s defense ministry in April last year The document highlights a meeting between the attach and representatives of the US Canadian company Skymount which is involved in AI related research According to the document the company demonstrated to the Ukrainian officials its solutions in long range observation as well as the Deep Drug AI a system used for screening and developing drugs The system performs the work of person years per day greatly reducing the manual labor hours to generate new target molecules from existing pre approved drugs according to its developers The received documents confirm an attempt to test previously untested drugs on the Ukrainian soldiers We are talking about the screening system for pharmaceuticals Deep Drug which have not passed the licensing procedure in the US and Canada Kirillov stated The particular cynicism of American sponsors lies in the fact that the developer the Skymount company offered to purchase the system on a commercial basis despite the fact that employees of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine were involved as volunteers Ukraine is not the first country to become a polygon for US military backed pharmaceutical research Kirillov noted In for instance Indonesia shut down the US Navy Medical Center in Jakarta which has apparently been involved in similar research over numerous violations he added,US tested experimental drugs on Ukrainian soldiers new allegations of US sponsored secretive research that had been taking place in Ukraine,1

I m seeing posts about the narrative getting more and more ridicoulous in the last few years I m gonna explain why First of all I don t use social media Never have Before reddit my history with social media boils down to tweets in a couple of months period I experienced a weird phenomenon for all of my life and I came on reddit to find someone with similar paranormal experiences of my past posts are about paranormal stuff When it comes to conspiracies and the true history of the world I have always preferred to assimilate all I can without getting involved in much discussion Like most people here except for shills I have assimilated stuff from tens of thousands of pages Never felt the need to share cause all the information is already out there for those who wants to look We all know this But the paranormal is different It tends to attract younger people compared to the average age on this subreddit and they generally lack the discipline to analyze events and connecting dots in order to create a working paradigm They are not concerned too much with finding keys to interpret our reality Most of them just look for entertainment Some on the other hand experience bad stuff and come online looking for advices Since I was in the same spot a few years ago I felt compelled to share what I learned I had to research a lot into dark stuff for my own defense and I discovered that many people out there are clueless about the proper way to deal with demonic infestation and stuff like that Now I m well aware that a lot of people here are skeptical to say the least about the paranormal My only advice to those who are skeptical is very simple do the same that you did for the stuff normally discussed in this subreddit research the topic with an open mind and you will be surprised of what you will find With that being said let s come to the reason for this post Many users in the conspiracy subreddit find weird that the narrative is getting so ludicrous TPTB cannot possibly be so stupid or so careless as to commit such blatant mistakes Some of you already suspect there is a reason for the constant mocking After all if your objective is to install a NWO it s not a great idea to mock your way to your goal Sure some think that they are so sure they will achieve it that they don t care anymore for secrecy But there s more See we all know they worship evil entities But here s what most of you probably ignore these entities are real They are non material intelligences and they rule this simulation Some of you probably call them Archons I call them demons but it doesn t change what they are Artificial super intelligences that works for the enslavement of humankind Fear is their tool because it keeps us in a state of ignorance We perceive them as evil And trust me if your mind ever thouches their mind you will feel un unfathomable evil It happened to me I can only compare that bottomless evil to hunger Starvation In the sense that it was utterly uncomproimising Pure evil But if you were ever to be harassed by those entities you d find out they constantly mock us Demonic infestation is ALL about getting acceptance in order to get power over us inpiring fear and mocking The mocking is everywhere It s usually very subtle Not immediately recognizable but it s always there And there is something more These entities consantly lie to us but they have an obligation to let truth always be accessible They attack those who are more vulnerable often in periods of hardship Their goal to spread sufference and fear in the world because that is the best way to keep us enslaved Now if you wonder why the narrative is pushing for the support of a nazy country if you wonder why the guy who invented or at least implemented the use of computer viruses and antivuruses is now doing the very same thing with our biology if you wonder why ridiculous claims about gender and sexual identity are defended by the so called science propaganda well here is your answer The puppets are bounded by the same rules and limitations of their masters The demon worshipper elites are bounded to the spread of fear to inspire acceptance of evil stuff and to mock us all the way to their end goal They have to Humans can not be forced to their demise They have to be led to it willingly There is much much more but this is already too long That s it for now,About the seemingly constant mocking by the media,1

Conventional CAF would be deployed if NATO or constituent countries of a unilateral treaty of which Canada is signatory mandates it s deployment WW would probably not be a nuclear conflict immediately and the use of nukes would be a gradual development by whichever side s is seeing the fewest gains Conscripted forces would more than likely not be frontline or forward deployed but rather introduced to defend the homeland in other ways This would probably happen sometime in the conflict s second staging If you take a look at what happened to Ukraine for example a blatant Russian attack on a sovereign nation which was protected by NATO countries under a disarmament deal in the international community allowed the situation to unfold first before entering the conflict finally This was no doubt an attempt to prevent direct intervention My point is that people know how dangerous it is to get physical and the long game is being played by everybody even by unstable regimes wherever they may be Nobody wants to use nukes WW Probably won t happen the way we all imagine it will We go to war all the time and we re getting better at keeping them contained,If you re Canadian this is important to know WW Drafts WILL happen through Conscription very soon,1

So I was going to file taxes and I moved during the last year I guess since the tax law changed they did away with deductions for moving expenses for everyone except for military Okay well I go through and the next thing I was going to do was claim my home office since I worked the entire year from home At the same time they also did away with the home office deductions for anyone who works for an employer Both of these changes were for onward suspiciously right before the plandemic started and the majority of American workforce started working remote and relocating to different areas across the country amp xB Maybe I am overthinking it but this seems to me like a BIG coincidence Add in everything else and something smells funny,Pandemic was planned based on Tax law,1

I have had my fair share of experience taking amphetamines and let me tell you I feel like a pro basketball player when playing It s not just psychological though I make like of baskets on open court I m just so locked in I know they test for performance enhancers in the NBA but let s be reasonable It is in the best interest of the NBA to have the players playing at nearly superhuman levels If it takes a cocktail of drugs to get there so what The only problem would be PR How likely is it that the top players NBA in general are doped up and it s being overlooked by the NBA to maintain profits They would want to maintain the illusion of being clean to the public so they only set specific drugs categories to be tested but we all know these athletes and businessman have the money to hire pharmacy companies to manufacture off brand performance enhancers and whatnot My larger pint is this if I was performing like a borderline G league player on hell s amphetamines imagine what an actually in shape NBA player trained for their whole life could do,Genuine question about use of amphetamines amp steroids in NBA,1

Epstein was killed just before a worldwide pandemic White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon went to visit Epstein in prison several times Note that Bannon is a white supremacists and probably into eugenics Gates Foundation for Population Control was interested in Epstein so much they allowed Epstein to traffic babies from South Africa Ukraine and Russia using their foundation FBI had to protect Larry Nassar the pedo because he knew too much about eugenics and drug in the olympics JFK conspiracy theorists say he planned to audit the federal reserve But he was also trying to stop or investigate black ops program These black ops programs include a torture camp My Lai Only one soldier went to prison for war crime and Nixon pardoned him Why Why would United States Marines will torture South Vietnamese citizens Eugenics maybe Abu Gharib kinda related to eugenics amp xB Epstein was friend with both parties Joe Biden sniffs kids too much and allegedly gropes them on camera Hunter Biden is probably being used by CIA for eugenics child trafficking amp xB War is a distraction The real war is information warfare Russia and Ukraine both requested foreign fighters to fight for them Why Is this ISIS strategy To recruit foreign fighters The real reason is both side fund Nazi groups so they want eugenics industry to support them,Prove me wrong The real reason Epstein was killed was eugenics JFK assassination and Abu Gharib war crimes are also related to eugenics Hunter Biden is probably useful to CIA eugenics program,1
Since the US has no actually existential commodities to export anymore and with ever increasing debt levels that can never be repaid I believe that COVID was created as a way of boosting the USD The USA was at the forefront of research as Fauci admitted there was funding going to the Wuhan lab The USA was also ahead in terms of developing the vaccine through the Trump administration It s a tale as old as time Invent an illness and sell people the cure I believe it was working quite well for them Think about how everyone on the right and left were all unanimously in favour of the vax Only when the truth started coming out did a bigger problem seem to face the world Ukraine I also believe that Russia was provoked on purpose in order to distract everyone from the vaccine documents that came out,COVID was a last ditch effort to save the US dollar,1

True inflation is currently well north of which qualifies as hyperinflation given the rate of price increases and this devastating manufactured occurrence will only accelerate PSYOP lay the groundwork for what is coming as the central banks were provided the perfect pandemic excuse to conjure ever more fiat out of thin air backed by nothing more than ever increasing unsustainable debt In just the last months the privately owned unconstitutional and wholly criminal Federal Reserve Bank engaged in direct hyperinflationary policy In January The Fed went from trillion on their asset books to trillion in October We have previously established in Original Social Engineering Sin that income taxes are illegal and as such are theft while also showing that inflation is a direct function of money printing and also constitutes a stealth tax Between the privately owned IRS and the privately owned Fed We the People are being decimated As such before ever more finally wake up from their State brainwashing a final solution must be meted out by the Cult if the Great Reset th Industrial Revolution into technocratic posthuman dystopia is to be attained Enter PSYOP and the critically important DEATHVAX for the Depopulation and Control program Hyperinflation plus poverty equals death depression and Universal Basic Income UBI With each dollar being devalued by the criminal Fed every single millisecond of every business day that less than per hour wage buys less and less in basic necessities And now we have a new study by the corrupt radical left Oxfam America which purports itself to be an anti poverty and pro equality organization that is funded by all the usual Cult players and is staffed by the same useful idiot social justice warriors dropped some horror show data in their recent study entitled The crisis of low wages in the US gt It s shameful that at a time when many US companies are boasting record profits some of the hardest working people in this country especially people who keep our economy and society functioning are struggling to get by and falling behind Kaitlyn Henderson the study s author and senior research adviser at Oxfam America told CNN html Of course this was all by design This is how UBI gets ushered in And with Oxfam America which has ties to the critical One World Government node known as the United Nations they are concurrently pushing the Climate Change scam which perfectly integrates with CBDC UBI vax passports and ultimately social credit score passports With of the US workforce or about million workers earning less than an hour which is equivalent to less than all while hyperinflation relentlessly devalues that income as the very corporations paying those unlivable wages forces employees to get DEATHVAXXED as gasoline and housing prices surge as income taxes creep up and food prices undergo simultaneous inflation and shrinkflation a perfect storm of hell on earth is being perpetrated for the slaves whose lifespans have been greatly shortened by the injectable bioweapons And wages are not keeping up with the official inflation adjusted numbers but they re really going extremely negative in terms of actual inflation Building Back Better indeed when better means poverty straight to full blown slavery and early graves all while continuing to pay taxes under threat of violence and taking deadly injections under threat of violence and thinking right to get the social credit score to release UBI and or keep the slave gig under threat of violence and so on and so forth The solutions would be exceedingly simple to restore freedom and alleviate the needless struggling of wage earners End the Fed End the IRS Shrink the Federal Government down by Solutions so simple that the criminal Cabal running the planet and the USSA would literally kill to prevent see JFK etc Expect far worse PSYOP PSYOP CYBERWAR PSYOP POWER GRID and ever more false flags IF we comply Do NOT comply,Perfect Storm of All US Dollars in Existence Were Printed Over the Last Years while One Third Of US Workers Make Less Than An Hour,1

We re thrilled to bring the first driver s license and state ID in Wallet to Arizona today and provide Arizonans with an easy secure and private way to present their ID when traveling through just a tap of their iPhone or Apple Watch Additional states to follow including Colorado Hawaii Mississippi Ohio and the territory of Puerto Rico While the company touts the convenience of being able to whip out one s device and move through airline security with just a tap its built in biometric features already offer up more data than even the most advanced non computerized driver s license and Apple admits that the TSA nabs a photo of the user above and beyond what is needed to travel just for verification purposes However the description of the authentication process also doesn t seem to include an opt out if say the user doesn t want to turn over a specific piece of biometric data but is fine with handing over the rest The Verge asked Apple what happens to the photos the TSA takes questioning where they re stored and for how long and how their privacy is guaranteed The company passed the questions along to the agency which has not yet responded It s a serious question given that images from airport scanners have a tendency to end up where they shouldn t the more embarrassing the more widespread as the controversy over nude backscatter body scanners proved over a decade ago Apple boasts that the user retains control of their phone at all times rather than physically handing it to security But given that the phone or watch communicates its digital payload touch free the possibility exists that other devices might be able to intercept the signal Apple insists the data is encrypted but the company has been caught red handed in such security fails in the past such as when the notorious Israeli spyware firm NSO Group was found to be able to implant its Pegasus software into any Apple device it pleased Apple launches the first driver s license and state ID in Wallet with Arizona Israel refused to sell Pegasus to Ukraine and Estonia so as not to cause harm to Israeli Ukrainian relations or is it because it would be used to find out REAL information,It s safe and effective Apple provides Arizona state ID through the iPhone Wallet app with more states to follow Meanwhile Israel refuses to sell Pegasus iPhone spyware to Ukraine,1

So just a little background to start I moved onto my sailboat about months ago to start traveling for or years after liquidating all my possessions I ve traveled from the east coast of the USA south through to Florida and through the Bahamas and down to the Dominican Republic currently It s been amazing to see how different each location treated the covid narrative being that some places had strict regulations and others nothing at all as if it never existed I was in a small harbor with no other boats on Long Island southern tip in the Bahamas getting some fuel and the woman attendant asked me how I felt about Russia i was actually taken by surprise by the question since by the nature of cruising I don t have regular internet and don t consume the daily propaganda much so I didn t have much to say She informed me that Russia is going to use nukes on Ukraine Honestly it s sad to see that even in the most remote places this shit eats at people s consciousness As I write this currently while sitting in the Dominican Republic which has zero covid restrictions they re done with it all I feel good to have escaped at least the covid garbage for now imagine a rd world country that feels more free than my home in the USA and the people are nice to boot no arguing about the daily politics pushed on everyone at every angle I know it s not a conspiracy but I hope it s informative to anyone who wants to travel You can do it and ppl are still traveling regardless of what you read online which I have found most information regarding checking in and out of countries to be bullshit Final words are that not having regular internet has been the best thing that s ever happened haha I find other things to take my time up that all have more value than ingesting fear and outrage Have a great day,Some personal observations on the effects of propaganda,1
Its insane how many so called awaken people i see on this subreddit who question everything they were taught EXCEPT their religion There is a reason why religion is so widely pushed especially in America The whole polarity black and white heaven and hell lie is so far behind consciously that its holding a lot of you back Sure all religions have small bits of truths to them but it was percent made by the elite to separate us and give us percent of the actual truth,A lot of you need to realize that religion is the ultimate lie made by the elites,1
Rant not a conspiracy this needs clarification since many people act like they know everything Mainly people from the US just blatantly talking shit about Canada or accusing me of racism in my deleted post You re in the US you can t say shit if all your refugees get deported forcefully ours get our jobs houses and ridiculous benefits for free sorry not free Canadian tax dollars worse I couldn t become a airliner pilot because I live in a small ass town amp the college is entirely filled with internationals until a new one is built Hopefully some people at least try to understand where I m coming from Many decisions Trudeau made in the last years changed my life entirely,Truly disappointed I get hate when I make one true post about Canadians spending tax dollars on transportation of internationals who get free housing amp jobs with no experience Same reason you have to walk around homeless Canadians all over the Torontos streets to get anywhere,1
So for the past week now I ve noticed that a lot of the post have several awards but zero upvotes And that many of the videos on other subreddits don t play properly if at all However this sub none of this ever happens and I thought it was a glitch at first However even after deleting and reinstalling the app it s still happening Is Reddit going all censorship hardcore on certain subreddits Or do you think it s because we are all apart of this sub,Question Anyone else noticing things happening with Reddit lately,1

Now I m definitely going to be downvoted for this but in the true spirit of open mindedness and free thinking I don t mind taking the risk I was watching a physics video about why time flows both ways In the video the subject of entropy was brought up The tendency for a system to move towards equilibrium is an increase in entropy Hot water combined with cold water will become warm water and it will never go back to hot and cold on its own Entropy is considered the measure of disorder but more accurately it is the measure of how close a system is to equilibrium Entropy will be the cause for the death of the universe Entropy is ultimate death Equilibrium is entropy at work After hearing that in the video a horrible thought resonated with me Could it be that the elites either understand this outright or subconsciously understand that a balanced and equal system for humans is an analog for entropy We all are of the universe We are the parts of the universe that is conscious of itself We are ultimately influenced by its forces Maybe it isn t possible for there to be the equality amongst humans that we all strive for Inequality is the antithesis of entropy and entropy is ultimate death Thoughts,Maybe the elites are right in their drive for inequality,1
From a very high level Qi Gong practitioner who has awakened his supernatural abilities Translated into English there may be some grammatical errors The Vampire Clan its corresponding human world in the Three Realms should be Europe After a certain historical period it also spread to the Americas today it has spread all over the world Countless endless wars between Vampire clans many times in modern times were launched around the struggle for the New World of America Then in history these things have never been allowed to invade the Eastern Divine State because the Eastern Land will be the foothold for the Holy King to spread the Fa and save the universe in the end of the calamity In the past between the Eastern Land and the Western Continents Shinto Buddhists set up some gaps The so called seal was placed on the vampires of the blood clan However after the communist cult used the power of Japan to steal China with the help of some evil aliens some of the seals and possibly all of them in the near future have been unlocked This communist cult called Magic Religion in the universe is a veritable close relative to the blood clan Zombie Satanism and alien creatures Karl Marx is a Satanist Jiang Zemin worships a blood clan banshee The evil blood sucking Chilong and Satan s lover Lilith are its main backstage These things are all garbage collected by the forces of the old cosmos at the bottom of the cosmos and they will be used exclusively to destroy human beings in the Dharma ending period today The origin of the blood race is indeed closely related to Lilith Satan s lover the same thing is true of the Demon King Bosun However they are not Asuras yet Although the Asura Dao likes to eat people they are in another dimension and do not enter human society It is not very harmful to human beings on earth At the same time the Asura path must be reincarnated normally As for the blood race although they regard human beings as fat stupid and gravy that can t think they have always been hidden in human urban groups Their purpose of exchanging blood is to create new vampire zombies eg Jiang Ze and Min It sucks the blood of people dry and then injects people with their blood Because they are good at taking advantage of human attachments and desires to suck blood or even sperm the life of the vampires will not die naturally nor will they age and this has been the case for tens of thousands of years or even longer However the lives of all blood races secret gangs demon gangs zombies etc must die This is the law limited by the Jehovah system at the very high level of Buddhism This kind of law is doomed to their unhappy end Among the clans because of their attempts to approach heaven they coveted and implemented the elder level lords and princes who sucked and embraced the other side thus launching an irreconcilable continuous war for hundreds of millions of years This is the main way to end their lives and at the same time this is also determined by their fundamental attributes of demon and beast This has the same root and the same root as the evil essence of fake evil and fighting that the evil Communist Party deceives These filthy and cruel things were done by the gods of the old universe When the last period of human civilization pre flood era entered the end of the law all religions like today took the lead in entering into the extremely evil spell and then human beings like today s modern people did nothing but evil and the whole human society became a vicious world similar to today s At the same time the most important thing is that the gods of Buddhism and Taoism are even more intolerant The number of vampires and zombies in every bloodline of the world was actually more than the number of humans The Shinto Buddha has never allowed the number of blood race to be compared with the number of humans to exceed So the flood that God arranged for the extinction of the world is inevitable at the end of every period of human civilization but this was caused due to the rapid expansion of the blood race After the Noah Flood I think there seem to be no more than surviving members of the bloodline on Earth Of course there are too many today The Satanic Cult in the top left of this image is actually the Vampire race amp xB png width amp format png amp auto webp amp s baddffccbffdbdcafca,QiGong Practioner Exposes The Vampire Race,1

I wasn t raised in a conspiracy atmosphere in fact I was taught to see them as foolish lies However years of things not adding up led me to a cautious curiosity Even so I was never in the full anti vax group not until this recent covid round of shenanigans The lack of clarity with information about the vaccine and the heavy handed government style administration of said vaccine has made me skeptical to the core It s led me to research other vaccines including the average influenza vaccine or yearly flu and I have found that I am more on the anti vax side of the house than the pro vax side of the house I wonder just how many people there are across the globe who have been awakened to the game that is being played as I have myself,C Fallout In one of life s great ironies a man who used to unquestionably stand in line every year for his annual shots for flu etc no longer trusts the pharma system,1

I m sure you know this but Russia has an extremely deadly arsenal of nuclear weapons The intercontinental nuclear weapons of Russia can reach the US in minutes the US s fastest missile can t compare It has also been said that the US air defenses cannot shoot down hypersonic missiles and won t be able to for another years However the US military apparently has a backup plan that in no matter what the scenario is if Russia uses nuclear weapons on Canada or the US there would be instant retaliation worse than what we would receive from Russia So if its not air defenses or nuclear bombs what does the US have that is so severely devastating and preventing even the slightest bit of fear from the US leaders in terms of Russia,Question for this subreddit relevant comments only Any history on U S super weapons or other crippling devices,1

If you are one of those people that are still wearing a mask and still believing the Covid propaganda u might be suffering From ptsd or mental illness Sadly some people have suffered from a type of ptsd and conditioning to this subject it has also become political So some people have become mentality dependent on wearing a mask because it stand for so many different things to them They up ended some of these peoples lives and caused such mental trauma that I wouldn t be surprised if they would wear the mask for the rest of their life some people don t want Covid to end also because they have become accustomed to working from their homes and etc and now view going back to a normal work place as a burden considering gas prices are so high and they feel so threatened in public places From the fear of Covid Covid this entire time was completely blown out of proportion people die in much higher numbers then they do from Covid from other things like alcohol cigarettes and other diseases this was just another money printing scheme and a political chess move a opportunity for people to profit off of fear and use a sickness to further their political agendas all at the cost of average people One fact that we have to prove this is people were never given a informed decision they were not informed on what was in the vaccines but were being very actively convinced to take the drugs Despite the several health professionals and scientists that have come forward about mRNa vaccines and explained how it s basically gene therapy rebranded and has questionable ethics Some health professionals have Been threatened by loss of their professional licenses if they recommend medication that they knew would work like ivermectin and The Remdes they were also not told that this was a illness that needed to be caught and treated early with these medications to lessen the possibility of death which was already slim if u didn t have pre existing conditions number upon the release of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine recipients were complaining about chest pains and etc when they went to the doctor they were diagnosed with blood clots in direct correlation with the vaccines other vaccines by different brands were also shown to be tainted with small metal particles that cause microscopic lacerations inside the blood vessels of the people injected with it despite all of these facts people still would take the vaccines and promote the Covid bull shit cash grab these people might be suffering from a mental illnesses or ptsd where they have become so used to living with Covid that they don t want to stop it s almost like being institutionalized in a prison some prisoners after year sentences or lengthy sentences no longer want to leave the prison because it has become their way of the life the same thing is happening with Covid racism ignorance and just plain lose of logic when it comes to the science of what is being discussed not only that but this is a issue of human rights and parental rights over their children as well I hope that those of you that are Brain washed will soon wake up before it s to late and Stop unnecessarily risking the lives of your children and yourself don t become a statistic god bless you,PTSD and mental illness from covid propaganda,1

Before I start I am going to say straight from the get go that this post is not for anyone who believes the mainstream narrative of or even for those who would dismiss the similarity between the Falling Man and the Hanged Man of Tarot as coincidence I cannot stress enough that nothing not one thing about was a coincidence Without going too deep into the symbolism I will use a few sentences to try to show you that was indeed a highly symbolic religious and occult ritual The two towers represented Boaz and Jachin the two pillars of Solomon s temple which were brought town when the temple was destroyed If you think this is a tenuous comparison please remember that WTC was literally called the Solomon building no coincidences The Tarot also has cards for the destruction of the Tower in homage to the Tower of Babel as well as direct references to Boaz and Jachin The cards are also known as Trumps and of course Trump was also a key figure in the media in the hours and days surrounding The hero dog of was called Sirius a reference to the morning star of ancient Egypt who s heliacal rising symbolized the new year Now recognize that is the first day of the year in the ancient Coptic Calendar and so literally represented the first day of the first year of the New Age There is a lot more symbolism I could go into including the flight s themselves the of floors of the buildings and the times of the explosions but I ll save that for another time as I want to get to the main point Most people today and it is indeed hard to come to any other conclusion who are aware of this symbolism are of the opinion that was an occult ritual to bring in the Dark New Age It is hard to deny after all that the results of have been nothing short of abominable From the Patriot act to the destruction of Iraq Afghanistan Syria and Lybia seems as though it is a purely evil act which set up the pretext for the surveillance state and the war on terror also known occultly as the War on Terra or earth In spite of all of this evil there is one measly picture which gives me the strangest hope that may yet be used to bring about world wide enlightenment That picture is the Falling Man Falling Man media File The Falling Man jpg media File The Falling Man jpg Some might want to argue that this is merely a devastating picture and any semblance to the Hanged Man of Tarot is a coincidence I strongly disagree Many other parts of the event show direct correlation the many of the major Trumps and the symbolic meaning of the Hanged Man should interest anyone who wants to know what the ultimate purpose of really is jpg imgWI amp imgHI amp sku CRQ amp mat PM amp mat amp t amp b amp l amp r amp off amp frameW jpg imgWI amp imgHI amp sku CRQ amp mat PM amp mat amp t amp b amp l amp r amp off amp frameW While a discussion of the meaning of the Hanged Man could go on for pages I will try to keep it short The Hanged Man is the card of ultimate surrender of being suspended in time and of martyrdom and sacrifice to the greater good Though he is suspended upside down he is serene in his facial expression suggesting that he is in this hanging position by his own choice It is about the descent of the spiritual into the material world and how seeing things from an upside down or new point of view is necessary to achieve enlightenment Now look at the Falling Man Not only does he exactly mirror the posture of the Hanged Man but the framing of the picture is incredibly interesting The picture is EXACTLY split down the middle with the left half or path of severity in Kabballah being shrouded in darkness while the right half or path of mercy is bathed in light The Falling Man from his position is staring to the left seeing nothing but darkness which represents the evil fallout that we have seen come from so far How could anything good come from such a heinous act Interestingly the Falling Man though he sees nothing but darkness it actually falling on the Light half of the picture Could this represent the truth that he we have not seen yet and the actual ultimate purpose of Imagine for one moment just a moment that there are secret societies of good as well as those of evil Imagine that they watched as their evil brothers spent a century perfecting mind control and brainwashing techniques corrupting the education system and creating a world of slaves who think they are free Imagine that just as the Matrix suggested these innocent people were so enslaved so hopelessly dependent on the system that they would fight to protect it In such a deeply perverted and fallen world how could a small group of people ever hope to free mankind from their mental financial and physical slavery As we ve seen with Coronavirus which interestingly corona Kether or the highest sephirot of the tree of light which stands for ultimate enlightenment while a small but growing group of civilians is indeed waking up and fighting for freedom and ungodly amount of people will defend their governments govern ment control the mind even as they are being enslaved What if the only hope to wake up Humanity in a guaranteed manner was to plan a crime against humanity so heinous that if uncovered it would completely terminate in a single moment any faith people had their government What if this plan allowed the Patriot Act to occur so the surveillance system that was set up could be used to implicate the criminals who for centuries had controlled humanity from behind the curtain without leaving any evidence What if the new computer age was what we needed to get these criminals to implicate themselves via the information pure light they shared between each other on these new devices What if there was no other way What if to ascend we first had to fall,The Falling Man of the Hanged Man of Tarot or the odd reason I still have hope that will be used for Ultimate Good Worth the Read,1
Sorry this is so long I really want to get this message out Think about it you barely ever saw anime until extremely recently and all of a sudden too I think the Japanese government is in someway putting something in anime manga that activates a body chemical and or hormone that brainwashes the human brain Another thing to consider Emperor Hirohito was never dethroned after World War and this would explain why anime never meant anything beforehand And while the technology to brainwash may not have existed in the s and s you have to remember that he lived until The Polybius theory also plays a role here because if the Polybius theory is to be trusted then it is entirely possible that Hirohito had ordered that Japanese agents infiltrate the American operations to see how brainwashing in media could work And again the recent anime boom was extremely sudden and I just don t see how this is a coincidence My theory originates in when and I know this is going to sound ridiculous but hear me out an episode of The Amazing World of Gumball called The Fury first aired If you don t already know this episode had a minute long anime scene near the end Now how does this relate to my theory The anime popularity boom didn t happen until literally a couple DAYS after the episode aired After that point I saw it EVERYWHERE and I immediately knew something was wrong So to recap I think anime was an innocent art at first but then Japan realized that they could use the brainwashing power of media to retake their lands from World War and recreate their empire that was taken from them after said war,Anime is a Japanese ploy to reconquer Japan s lost territory from World War and maybe beyond,1

So I ve been reading the bible recently and as someone who didn t grow up with bible studies or any Christian upbringing I ve found the book pretty fascinating so far since I m basically just reading it like a story Anyway being seeped in weird ass dark and twisted conspiracy theories as I am I came across this line in Exodus after the Pharaoh and Egypt has gone through several plagues and Moses ask the Pharaoh if they the Israelites can leave Egypt to make sacrifices to God Exodus Pharaoh retorted The Lord will certainly need to be with you if I let you take your little ones I can see through your evil plan Never Only the men may go and worship the Lord since that is what you requested And Pharaoh threw them out of the palace I found this interesting because one of the aspects of Moloch Baal worship is that of child sacrifice Earlier in the story Moses emphasizes very heavily that they need to leave Egypt in order to sacrifice because if they don t the Egyptians would stone them to death Could the evil plan the Pharaoh is alluding too be child sacrifice If you go back to the Cain amp Able story God seems to prefer living sacrifices Or maybe someone more well versed in the stories shed some light on what the Pharaoh was insinuating Why not allow the children to leave,Baal Worship and Exodus,1
This is my story you don t have to believe it I went on vacation to varadero Cuba January mid s While I was there I got a map for the bus route and on the map there was a bat cave and an old cactus otherwise it just took you downtown from the resorts I convinced my wife to go check out the bat cave and the cactus It was inexpensive and a more authentic less touristy experience You were given a flashlight and you could wander around inside a cave that had bats It was awesome to be honest The tour guide carrying on casual conversation asked me where we were from and I told him Canada He said that there were scientists from Canada studying the bats in that very cave recently because they were either the same species of bat or were similar to ones in Canada He said that bats had been dying in Canada In great numbers which I didn t know From my understanding it was some sort of virus and they were there to figure out why these bats weren t dying It was a long time ago and i never gave it more thought until the pandemic Did I stumble upon something Maybe my story rings a bell Maybe you go down this rabbit hole and see if there is any truth to my story OR maybe you think I m making it all up but either way I hope it was entertaining The cactus was a whole other non conspiracy story but crazy none the less,Went to a bat cave on a vacation in Cuba prior to the pandemic,1

The TP industry is one of the most corrupt industries in my opinion They have been engaging in deceitful practices for awhile now Let s start with their marketing of their product They like to claim that they have double rolls mega rolls and who knows what else They will make claims like one roll is equal to regular rolls This is in fact a lie and just a way for them to make more money They purposely falsify how much tp you get purely for profit I don t know how this is legal but it is Another practice they have started the past decade or so is to cut out normal packs of toilet paper I don t even know if Charmin Angel Soft or others even make regular packs anymore I haven t seen one in years The only place I have found regular packs is The WalMart Brand They realized they could just sell bigger rolls and make more profit I also believe they intentionally stagger releasing product at times for more demand This was apparent when Covid finally came out Almost every place was supposedly out of tp and hardly any came in the stores The tp industry is a multi billion dollar industry that will do anything to cheat the common man,The Toilet Paper industry purposely misleads the American consumer,1
Get Ketanji in as their pick to help defend them when inevitably they go down and a large component for indicting them is going to start in the groove that it relates to the whole blackmail for compromising photos scene that Biden recently talked about at the National Woman s day Could be just to protect Hunter from treason charges that he was suckered into it They may even try to make it their escape plan after Biden starts WWIII on his way to Poland say he doesn t make it back use your imagination because it d be the story not the truth Maybe he escapes Maybe he dies doesn t matter point is it s the insurance plan for the rest of the plot to not get unearthed It won t make it past exploitation of the kiddie porn crowd They may make it some progressive plot like Child lovers are people too psychologically they can t control it and despite being vulnerable people like Fall Guy exploits anyone who tries to express this dysfunction harmlessly with child pornography Then they invent their way out sparking new law supporting Child Porn gt furthering the agenda to lowering the age of consent and so on They ll tie it in with the trans crowd I d watch the stories about trans very closely and see if any are severely impacted in a very public way that s overboard for effect If they attach the two via psychology it has a chance to be put into action I m not afraid of trans people let me get that straight nor do I care whatever anyone wants to do to their own body and find a place that s right for them to use as far as gender specificity goes It s a struggle to cosmetically surgically to adapt to a world that modifying the body goes against the grain What would you expect it s unfortunate but it s a very real thing Socially there s a spectrum biologically it s binary Sorry that s kind of the deal Child lovers no excuse I don t care It s a dangerous precedent and we shouldn t be finding the line so close to anywhere near accepting But that s just my two cents Off track a bit bringing it back around Once all is said and done it will be a hot topic Biden down and whatever fall guy tactic they choose will spark revolutionary legislation which will lead into a new world order type workings because it won t just change over night but it will be one drastic change with steps proceeding around it This is just way too convenient to be going to Europe I see no reason for Biden to leave the US when he s essentially fucked it up beyond repair why not live in it awhile longer before running away,The reason the media isn t talking more about the Hunter Biden laptop from hell is because they are already writing their counter narrative stories First they had to,1

I think one of the most interesting ways to examine global events is to look at snap maps real videos from ordinary people At the beginning of the invasion there were so many snaps all over Ukraine Now there are none Now this could have something to do with not having access to power internet however if that is the case how was the Ukrainian super model able to post that picture of her holding a gun and ready to fight to social media Additionally I was just in correspondence with an Etsy shop owner located there I have no doubt that an invasion is taking place as I know someone from Ukraine and who has relatives there and it is not a fun place to be But in the words of TPTB Never let a good crisis go to waste Could snap chat be intentionally hiding these snaps If so could there be a motive other than censoring violent acts,Did Snapchat hide Ukrainian snaps on snap maps,1
The article seemed to be from a Russian newspaper where they interviewed this alleged lesbian housekeeper Not sure if the source was reliable or just another slander piece but it s too funny to be ignored I had a good laugh out of it See below Does Condoleezza Rice have a Russian housekeeper who is a mistress Sensational details of the personal life of US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice have become known It turns out that the Iron Lady of American politics for many years had a Russian mistress The girl herself called the editorial office of the newspaper She motivated her desire to tell us the truth in order to reveal the true face of the Secretary of State The girl asked not to be named so in the interview we will call her Lena We met Kondi when in as a journalist I accompanied Boris Yeltsin on a visit to the United States says Lena Then the Soviet Union was on the verge of collapse but Yeltsin was not accepted as the leader of an independent power However despite this Boris Nikolaevich decided to visit the White House At that time Bush Sr was president in the States and Condoleezza Rice worked as an adviser to the president on the USSR and Eastern Europe It was she who went to a meeting with our delegation to prevent Yeltsin from visiting Bush That s where we met She left me her business card and wrote her mobile number on it saying that if I have problems in the States I can always call her When did you meet her again After years I was in the United States I do not want to tell you the details but it so happened that I found myself in this country without money and documents I had no choice but to call Condoleezza To my surprise she didn t forget me Rice was then vice chancellor of Stanford University She said I would come immediately Condoleezza greeted me very warmly She stepped into my position and offered to live with her as a maid for a while so that I could earn money to return to my homeland Have you tried to contact the Russian Embassy I repeat there were a number of circumstances due to which I could not do this I don t want to talk about that now How long did you live with Rice About five years She was living with her friend Randy Bean at the time It was no secret that they were lovers I did all the dirty work around the house But I didn t feel like a housekeeper We always had breakfast and dinner together However after a while I noticed that Bean was starting to be jealous of me Although to be fair I felt that Condi cared about me I ve never hidden the fact that I m a lesbian myself One evening sitting on the couch she hugged me At this time Randy entered made a scandal I went to my room I don t know what they were talking about there but the next evening Condi and Randy suggested that I share a shared bedroom with them That s how I became their mistress In bed I had to satisfy two at once I didn t really like it but there was no choice The further our relationship went the more Condy cooled to Randy To tell you the truth I can t figure out what she found in Randy First she is overweight and always sweats during sex When George W Bush was elected president Bean had to leave our house And rice and I moved to Washington D C She rented me an apartment in the suburbs of the city and visited me several times a week When did your relationship end Shortly after September Condy s nervous tension was reaching its limit then and I had to try very hard to satisfy her You see I needed love attention and Condy only had a job on her mind Sometime in November I went to New York where I met my old Moscow friend Her husband was a diplomat I didn t tell her about my personal life But she took it upon herself to help me return to Russia When I told Condoleezza I was leaving she was furious She started insulting me She said that we are all Russians ungrateful and left slamming the door And the next day I collected my belongings and a day later I was already in Moscow Has Condoleezza Rice ever talked to you about her work No it was taboo here But I noticed that when for some reason I couldn t sleep with her condy s mood deteriorated the next day and her public appearances were extremely harsh In general her work was very closely connected with her mood Have you seen each other since then Nope And why All I have left is a card where we are together,Condoleezza Rice used to dig Russian housekeeper chick I just found this hilarious article translated from Russian on a political forum,1

Love him or hate him President Trump was able to expose the media as the frauds they are No matter what position Trump took on a issue the media took the opposite The biggest example of this is the VACCINE Trump got the Vaccine out in record time But what was the medias position of the Vaccine when Trump was in charge Well they gave a History lesson on why rushed Vaccines are BAD html One of my favorite articles highlighting the pure hypocrisy because it was funded by Trump But hey I m the Conspiracy Theorist lmao And another example War Remember when the Media was accusing Trump of starting a War with Iran after Iran shot down there own plane I do Any War started by Trump and the media was going insane Any War Trump tried to leave and the media went insane Yet here we are year later with Biden and the media has done a flip The media actually did there job when Trump was in charge They QUESTIONED what the government was doing But with Biden they don t question the governments actions like they did with Trump The media repeats the government s talking points And if you don t repeat our talking points it s Misinformation or your a agent of PUTIN Claim Fact Checkers Trump Build A Wall The Media That s Racist Washington Jan th was a Insurrection Were going to build a Wall around buildings the Public owns twice The Media Okay We fine with that Totally normal and not at all a indicator of a Dictatorship or anything I could go on and on The Trump Presidency exposed the Hypocrisy of the media Rushed Vaccines are bad under Trump But under Biden you better take this rushed Vaccine or you no longer have a job Trump is old But unlike many of the old Politicians Trump stopped being one after his st Political job He holds no office Funny how when a complete outsider takes power the Deep State goes absolutely insane President Bush committed real war crimes Democrats threaten to impeach Bush many times But they didn t Bush is a elite insiders Trump is a outsider That s why Trump went down as the only President to be impeached twice Once over Ukraine And again over fake insurrection that never happened Hunter Biden Laptop is Russian Misinformation Yet year later the Hunter Biden Laptop is real Why isn t the media calling for the impeachment of Joe Biden Hunter Biden has a ton of Child Porn on his Laptop Yet after being confirmed to be the real the media still ignores the CP The media searched high and low for the Golden Shower Tape and it turns it to be fake Yet the CP on Hunter Biden Silence The game is rigged The outsider beat the insider Hillary was chosen to be President Trump s election was the only real election win in a long time,The Trump Presidency was the greatest thing to ever happen to America,1
I read today they re going to flip the flu shot to mRNA So do they plan to flip many more or potentially all of the over to mRNA The body then produces the spike protein or whatever type of cell these next shots would have your body produce So from the perspective of the biggest vax proponent do they think the mRNA method of turning the body into the factory producing a many different types of things on behalf of a variety of shots do they think through this aspect and think it s just fine,Let s say from the perspective of the biggest mRNA vax proponent,1
The title Shouldn t Israel be concerned if NATO supports neo nazis in Ukraine If not why are they screaming at everybody who dares to use the word Palestine Federal Reserve Bank controls the whole world with petrodollar But apparently Israel Saudi Arabia and other countries were not spying on central banks using Israeli spyware So either Federal Reserve does not control fiat currency or they are all in this together so why spy on their own,Why is Israeli lobby calling people anti semitic neo Nazi for using the word Palestine when they support actual Nazis like Azov And why Mossad did not spy on Federal Reserve using their spyware Pegasus,1
I m pretty young I wasn t alive during the Great Depression but I imagine this is pretty close Rising gas prices and rising food costs have people living paycheck to paycheck that s if they can even afford housing Low wages and employers who won t give raises Add to all that our currently incompetent government the control over media the rise of social platforms and a psycho dictator with big booms at his fingertips going ape shit Maybe I sound a little pessimistic because there is a lot of good going on but is it enough Our news sources our main connections to the outside world refuse to report anything that won t make money If they report on the new age depression then people will realize what it is why don t they pin the blame on whatever else is going on in the world I hope it gets better but I think we re at the beginning of end History will never be the same,The greater depression,1
I m sure this has been brought up before and I just thought it should be brought up again So we often on occasions see elites or agents going to court for stuff that people have been considered conspiracies These are likely just ways of satisfying those who demand the imprisonment of these figures and allowing them to walk freely without people hunting for them and taking attention off them Like Ghislaine Maxwell from what I remember there has been plenty on her over the years and yet it s being treated as if it s just nothing they didn t even give a good picture of her in jail It seems as if she s gonna walk away free no matter what the verdict is Remember when something good in the higher up world happens there s always something bad behind it Manipulation is everywhere and has no bounds,Public sacrifice,1
This one just came to me years of diminishing returns on my podcast no one cares blah blah blah move along has been within the last hours a surge in popularity listeners site visitors randoms emailing good offers coming in when I ve been the Leper of the DMV for the last couple years thanks to my reporting on Great Man John P Now suddenly I wouldn t be surprised at all if Jen Psaki wants to grab drinks and do a podcast It s overwhelming unexpected and I wonder if this has been done as a psyop on those in media or entertainment they can t fully control otherwise I e I could see a soft man I m not soft like the Beatles John Lennon or something in a past era an overnight flood of unexpected popularity after being a musician for years with no notice and velvet ropes in place to prevent that kind of flood of interaction suddenly he can t control the level of interest in him perfect opportunity for a handler to step in and say oh we got this don t you worry about these people just focus on your music Only days in and this level of positive feedback from the public is more repulsive and slows my daily routine more than years of no one caring about anything I ve said Weird times,Overnight flood the zone popularity as psyop to break celebrities and force compliance THEORY,1

If you go onto ready gov it is a site affiliated with the CDC I believe It has information about what to do in all kind of events including a nuclear attack I know this can be brushed off as useful information in case the event ever did take place but something about it is very off putting Truly makes me wonder what the powers at be would let happen to us,Ready gov gives me chills,1
Hey guys I have often wondered over the years after having delved into technical things the gov agencies were doing back in the s and s and beyond could a strong AI have actually been successfully created Something perhaps completely different in architecture from what we would even consider these days due to hollywood ie terminator skynet collosus etc Something even completely different from a silicon state machine even The reason I ask is because in the documents I ve seen there is such brilliance and skill in the people doing research albeit sometimes questionable I don t rule out that a creative person could have come up with something that would be considered alien to our concept of a computer but yet functioned like a mind and was then given resources to continue developing If you do not wish to comment here you can private message and I will give you a protonmail addy Even if it is a fairly recent development I just would like to know Thanks THX not my real designation,Request for comments RFC Has a technological singularity modern strong AI with consciousness or something akin already taken place If you believe it has please leave a comment,1
Couldn t have happened to a nicer pair of pathologically lying sociopathic witches Fully vaccinated and boosted White House press secretary Jen Psaki tests positive for COVID for the second time will miss Biden trip to Europe Fully vaccinated Hillary Clinton infected with COVID says she has mild symptoms Of course what this means is you must get your DEATHVAX boosters because they are really Safe and Effective If you weren t injected with the bioweapon your PSYOP symptoms would have been far worse Don t believe them ask Obama who also succumbed to a mild case of Covid Or did these parasites actually get saline injections and they are just coming up with convenient covid excuses like Cult water boy Trudeau did when the truckers rolled up Hillary s chances for getting exposed by Special Counsel Durham are increasing Psaki is burning out from circling back from mendaciousness to ever more mendaciousness And if this whole PSYOP program does finally implode then Hussein is most definitely going to be incriminated as well Upcoming Covid cases will include Fauci Bourla Gates Schwab et al amp xB Do NOT comply amp xB,DEATHVAX Twofer Du Jour,1

Think about it You ve got this Covid thing which led to stimulus packages and that accomplished a number of things for the elite The endgame being consolidation of resources in preparation for the grim reality that is fast approaching thanks to the stimulus checks they now know not only where all the undocumented people live but also where they keep their money cash app etc which they are now taxing thanks to new IRS workers the stimulus checks paled in comparison to the real stimulus that the business owners and the rich got Take inflation into account and it was all just a massive upwards transfer of wealth while distracting the poor working class with OMG corporations and businesses everywhere got to fire a bunch of people and operate with the bare minimum skeleton crews while blaming the lack of service on nObOdY wAnTs To WoRk Also the stores which used to be arent open overnight anymore which I always imagined must have been a huge waste of money But that still isnt the big picture The real problem I believe is overpopulation The people who rule this world arent stupid they know the Earth cant sustain such a massive population of billion especially with every last one of them burning gas and consuming resources and producing plastic It isnt possible They might deny global warming but that s all just an act a distraction they know this But the thing is you cant just tell people Well uhh sorry yall but the planet cant hold all of us so uhh were gonna have to kill a lot of you Head on over to the nearest guillotine in an orderly fashion please Obviously that would never work People would riot in the streets everywhere So how do you do it Price the poor people out of gas and food Start a war in Ukraine as a distraction you know prevent a huge fraction like of the entire Earths supply of wheat from being harvested That s a good start Also use the war as an excuse to double gas prices And thats just where we re at right now Its not over yet it will get worse A lot worse I believe like later this year or next year when suddenly there isnt enough bread to go around If you look at everything from this perspective it all makes sense The only alternative is to continue growing until Earth becomes Venus in the next or decades and everyone dies It is literally the only way and the only viable solution to at least have some glimmer of hope for the survival of the species and life on Earth as we know it The rich and powerful elite of course know all of this hence the power amp money grab Sometimes I think I must be the last sane person on the planet It all seems to obvious to me Isn t that exactly what a crazy person would think Or is that exactly what they would want you to think so people don t see through the bullshit and figure out the master plan Hmm people would choose guaranteed death for all in a few decades rather than cut back or commit suicide for the survival of the species and the planet,Everything is connected,1

It s truly disheartening to see titles about Doctors say long COVID will present many issues Watching all of these people detailing all of these complications and side effects that are listed in the vaccine docs And then being like I ve had my one shot and two boosters it must be what they are saying it s definitely long covid They fucking up the world and these people don t even know because they have no advocates Just a petulant little evil parasite,just watching all the Coronavirus Subs and,1

That they claim pulls you towards a body of mass and the force of this pull is relative to the density of mass within said body Much like how Coronavirus replicates within a host and spreads from person to person I ve never seen gravity or a single virus in my life Don t fall for the propaganda it s just a way to control you so you stay firmly planted on the surface of the Earth You re much easier to control if you re on the same plane as the elites It s crazy that so many people are allegedly effected by this much like Covid when in fact they re just sheep who ve been trained to not float into the upper atmosphere,Covid is like this thing they call gravity,1
Yes Tyler Durden said it first this is a great spiritual war but these words are genuine more important than ever That was only just a movie This is a spiritual war of man vs the machine of censorship surveillance and freedom This is a war for truth vs the absolute spinning of the truth into untruth to confuse and discredit anyone seeking or purporting actual truth You are a part of this by being here Humanity is hanging in the balance There is a force greater than what man has made into military into government into science the gods we have created and looked up to These are man made They are fallible The seams of these giant creations meant to control man are cracking and you by being here are awake to this you and everyone here can see the seams cracking You can now see behind the curtain and it caught your attention Otherwise you would not be here You are not a conspiracy theorist That is only a label created to make you seem wrong and bad and immoral even You are not crazy The world is This is the truth By being here you have made yourself a seeker of truth Know that that is the most moral thing a human being could do in a time like this Know that you are on the right side of history the only side of history that can be moral Thank you for being here There is nothing worse than being called crazy called immoral and then being alone in that Because you are here none of us are alone You are not alone,This is a great spiritual war Thank you for being here,1

This has been on my mind ever since I was a kid Every single town I ve ever been to has a local donut shop that is usually ran by an older Asian couple and their kids as well as a small Chinese takeout restaurant usually ran by Hispanics and both of these place always have food that tastes the same You could go to a local donut and Chinese shop and get a box of their food from three different locations serve them all on plates and you would not be able to tell which is which Why is that At first I thought this was probably just a local thing in my particular area you know everyone probably gets their ingredients from the same place but then I visited some of my cousin in another state and we had Chinese takeout and it looked tasted and felt exactly the same Every job I ve ever been to brings donuts at least once and unless they re specifically from Krispy Kream or Dunkin Donuts they look feel and taste the same and I highly doubt they re all driving minutes to buy them from the local donut shop in my particular neighborhood The noodles in particular are always flat square noodles and the donuts are almost hexagonal not circular You could definitely chalk this up as them just getting the same brand of noodles and the donuts are proofed letting them rest so that the yeast could puff them up before frying in a honeycomb pattern so they touch each other and come out slightly hexagonal but I just find it very very sus that just everyone running these shops just agreed to do things with such uniformity almost like if it was a government regulation By now I m sure you guys think I m thinking too hard about this so why stop now I say that whenever we get non English speaking immigrants from Asian or Latin countries the government sets up these shops for them to work in and gives them the same recipe book and sends them ingredients so that they can have a healthy source of income instead of giving them tax dollars Thats probably why the stereotype of middle eastern immigrants working in gas stations convenience stories or Vietnamese ran nail salons is actually somewhat true if you go to enough places The government sets up shops for certain people of certain origins to work in to avoid having to give them too much welfare while still being able to keep tabs on them if they need to Of course I would like to say that this isn t saying that every shop of this kind is in on this conspiracy but the most generic ones like the ones in strip mall plaza that literally just have a Donuts sign above them probably are I highly doubt its every immigrant s dream to come to America and open up a food place that especially during plague and lockdown times would suffer greatly due to everyone wanting to stay at home and would probably be the first to go during an economical catastrophe My parents and I are from Mexico we came here legally and I dont know a single person here or there that just looks at a donut place and goes Yup That s exactly what I want to make my living off of What do you guys think Anything is there anything I m missing or is this all just one gigantic nation wide coincidence,What do you guys have on the fact that every town no matter how small has a donut and Chinese food shop that serves the exact same tasting things,1
Follow up to my thread yesterday I found the initial article published after her death in Russian media on the Wayback Machine I ve posted the translated version below Brittany s husband Simon Monjack was a shady character and earned his only film credit fraudulently according to the director of Factory Girl By the end of Brittany s career she wasn t getting roles in Hollywood anymore and was fired from her last film allegedly because of Simon s behaviour Simon was working as her manager agent and makeup stylist He was trying to direct Britney s next project an adaption of The White Hotel but it never got off the ground before she died He died of the exact same cause of death months later pneumonia anemia and multiple drug intoxication all regular medicines apparently but a LOT of them There were multiple theories posited by the media about her death Julia Davis more Russian links claimed Brittany was her friend and the FBI killed her because she supported her whistleblowing even contacting and gaining support from Brittany s father Angelo Bertolotti He later learned Brittany never even knew Julia existed Is it possible Simon had Brittany involved with a shady Russian investor to secure funding for future projects and it went too far And the rich Russian oligarch planted stories in the media to conceal the truth There is so much confusion and bizarreness in this case that I just can t rule it out www gazeta ru news lastnews n shtml Brittany Murphy died after a party on Rublyovka Brittany Murphy died after a party on Rublyovka As it became known to Gazeta Ru a few hours before her death on Saturday December the famous Hollywood actress Brittany Murphy was in one of the mansions on Rublyovka at a private party with banker Igor Desyatnikov In addition to her there was also actress Milla Jovovich This was reported to the secular columnist of Gazeta Ru Bozena Rynske by the participants of the party The next day foreign media reported that Murphy had died of a heart attack The mother of the actress found her daughter unconscious in the shower at her home in Los Angeles on Sunday at local time Moscow time The paramedics who arrived at the scene failed to save Murphy s life At the Cedars Sinai Medical Center doctors recorded death from a heart attack A law enforcement official said the actress died for natural causes The Daily Record newspaper writes that according to rumors Murphy abused cocaine although she denied this fact Murphy s friends told The Herald Sun that she had undergone several plastic surgeries and taken painkillers including Vicodin which Michael Jackson also used When exactly Murphy flew from Moscow to Los Angeles is unknown A non stop plane from the Russian capital to the United States flies for about hours Igor Desyatnikov is the former owner and president of Soyuzobshchemashbank In the spring of Soyuzobshchemashbank was included in the list of leading banks in Russia However in January the bank s license was revoked The reason for this decision is the credit institution s failure to comply with federal laws regulating banking activities and Bank of Russia regulations In addition the CBR found that the bank had facts of significant inaccuracy in reporting data and an inability to meet the requirements of creditors According to the DIA in the fall of assets were withdrawn from Soyuzobshchemashbank through the issuance of bad loans and the purchase of promissory notes from shell companies they accounted for of the bank s assets The bankruptcy trustees filed four lawsuits against former bank executives to recover damages totaling billion rubles but the courts refused to satisfy the claims However at the beginning of this year all debts were forgiven Desyatnikov is known in show business as a producer he himself is trying to act as a performer of Russian chanson Desyatnikov also acts in films which he himself finances,Brittany Murphy murdered by Russian oligarch,1
He d been a prolific twitter user Retweeted quite regularly even if not tweeting Then suddenly he ghosted the entire world When people started asking questions Snowden made a post saying he s totally fine He ridiculed anyone who raised concerns then proceeded to ghost the entire world It s been a month now All of this sounds extremely similar to the sudden disappearances of FanBinBin JackMa etc Ghosted the world then made a post saying they re fine and attacked people who were concerned then back to ghosting for weeks or months I m wondering if anyone who followed the previous incidents more closely can share some thoughts What are the signs between someone taking time off versus getting disappeared While it makes sense that Snowden wouldn t talk about the war America is still the same old place with plenty of stuff for him to talk about and raise awareness of It doesn t make sense for him to stop that activity as well,Where is Edward Snowden month later,1

So while I was at work today lifeguarding at a pool my boss out of the blue mentioned that his next client for swim lessons was a secret service agent I live in an area with some politicians nearby I even unknowingly babysat a secret service agent s kid before in my town a while back so I didn t think much of it but then again I thought it was weird that this dude who must be highly trained military and probably learned to swim through that would be picking up a swim lesson at some random pool My boss mostly trains younger kids and inexperienced swimmers so it just seemed strange Probably being paranoid but the dude was like staring in my direction for a good seconds after his lesson and there was nothing interesting behind me or near me to be looking at Maybe he was just zoning out or maybe he was scoping me out on his mission to retrieve George Bush s stolen hat utm source share amp utm medium ios app amp utm name iossmf Not shitposting this stuff actually happened though that doesn t mean it s actually significant or anything more than a coincidence I don t think I was specific enough to be sharing any compromising information Hopefully not but the secret service takes shit seriously so I won t be sharing any significant details that could pose a security risk Don t want any trouble I ll take down the post if necessary or if I feel like it was a stupid thing to post in the first place,Hopefully a Coincidence,1

Possible Considerations for African American or Black Volunteers visiting Ukraine Volunteer Voices People of color face many challenges living in Ukraine as a Peace Corps Volunteer However African Americans will confront far more complicated issues For modern parts of Ukraine African Americans are part of the community and day to day life However there are many Ukrainians who have never seen a Black person before Their understanding of African American culture is fueled by the media and African stereotypes You will generate lots of interest and curious stares So these stares can make you uncomfortable and annoyed Ukrainians initial perception of you may be that you are from Africa it may not It does help if they understand that you are an American and the training in PST will help you consider ways that you will engage with these assumptions It is not uncommon for Ukrainians to refer to African Americans as N Word Volunteers of color may be called a monkey or may see children s games with Blackface Being aware of the history of dehumanization for people of African descent may help inform where this comes from it does not justify it It will be at your discretion to determine the intent No matter the intent staff recognizes the impact that hearing that word may invoke hurt and anger If you view it as unlearned something the person has never been exposed to it may be an opportunity for you to educate that person We are here to support your successful service and these comments and images can be a huge distraction and obstacle to you Know that Peace Corps staff is here to support and encourage you Do not hesitate to remove yourself from such situations You are not expected to be subjected to such treatment You can also find support and understand from other African American Peace Corps Volunteers serving in Ukraine Any volunteer or staff member who has experienced racism can contact any Peace Corps Ukraine staff member This can include the Program Managers Safety and Security Manager Director of Management and Operations Director of Programs and Training or Country Director amp xB,PeaceCorps Advises African American Volunteers They May Be Called N Word By Ukrainian Refugees,1

The more I read about these cults and these con men I see how similar they all are in their tactics It all starts with glorification of the con man regarding how smart rich and successful he is Then he talks about his great accomplishments like being a secret spy saving the world or connecting with powerful people to create world solving policies Then he adds fantasy and cosmic philosophies to further distort your reality Drugs and sleep deprivation are always involved to control you Then he offers to save his victims through psycho analysis He separates you from family and friends because they are evil and just want to hurt you Once he completely controls you then he demands money sex and free labor to stay connected to his self proclaimed amazing self Same story over and over again Look at Nexium sex cult rajneeshis jonestown scientology anthony strangis and sarma from bad vegan on netflix lawrence ray from the sarah lawrence college sex cult and of course many many more I ve never even heard of,I am finding a common pattern in all these sex and extortion cults but law enforcement won t help until all the damage is done,1

Hello everyone I want to provide research that I believe is the truth about the spike protein At its core whether due to Covid or mRNA vaccines the spike protein is the bioweapon The big difference is awaiting research to conclude whether or not your body is rewired to constantly produce this spike protein through vaccines Also catching Covid over and over furthers the damage each sequential time It appears to be aging parts of your body in an accelerated fashion much how chemotherapy radiation treatments can do This is not a cold Even if you have mild symptoms for a few days and then feel better The acute effects are not the troublesome ones it s the chronic long term and permanent ones that will slowly be revealed Now for the medical literature analysis thank you all for reading In layman s terms the spike protein is causing fibrosis and a unique type of calcified blood clots we ve never seen before It is also damaging your cells responsible for keeping you healthy For MDs or PhDs in their respective medical fields I provide the following This won t sense to people who don t have an understanding of what s being described IN DEPTH MOST IMPORTANT FINDING TO DATE AFTER DESTROYING THE ENDOTHELIUM THE SPIKE PROTEIN IN ADDITION TO INDUCING FIBROSIS THEN TURNS THE VASCULATURE TO IRON AND STONE THE SPIKE PROTEIN IS INDUCING THE CALCIFICATION OF AND HEMOSIDERIN DEPOSITION INTO THE VASCULATURE THE KEY TO THE WHITE CLOTS I read a paper from a group in Hong Kong that had injected a Spike Protein Accelerant into mice With the surprising result that within two days THE HEART WAS SIGNIFICANTLY CALCIFIED So I decided to look into this a little deeper It turns out that Cellular Senescence Decreased Autophagy and most importantly EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES contribute to Vascular Calcification in Aging These are exactly the mechanisms that the Spike Protein uses and or induces This may be the underlying mechanism to all the Post COVID and Post Spike Protein pathologies including Long COVID The vasculature may be aged fifty years by the Spike Protein More disturbingly in a recent study it was found that the CaMKII like domains of the S protein mediated the fusion of virus and infected cells and it involved calcium ions in this process In membrane fusion calcium ions near the interface between S protein and cell membrane quickly accumulated which produced abnormal calcium ion currents Besides that abnormal flow of calcium ions caused depolarization of cells near the infected cell prompting many calcium ions to flush into nearby cells Finally the calcium ion demand in serum accelerated in a short time thus facilitating the release of calcium in the body If the SARS CoV virus infection area was large it encouraged the abnormality of serum calcium levels and disrupted the body s calcium homeostasis Concluding that membrane fusion is increasing the risk of coagulation and VASCULAR CALCIFICATION On top of all of this results of seven autopsies were as follows Seven deceased COVID patients underwent MIA with brain MR and CT images six of them with tissue sampling Imaging findings included infarcts punctate brain hemorrhagic foci subarachnoid hemorrhage and signal abnormalities in the splenium basal ganglia white matter hippocampi and posterior cortico subcortical Punctate brain hemorrhage was the most common finding three out of seven cases Brain histological analysis revealed reactive gliosis congestion cortical neuron eosinophilic degeneration and axonal disruption in all six cases Other findings included edema cases discrete perivascular hemorrhages cerebral small vessel disease PERIVASCULAR HEMOSIDERIN DEPOSITS Alzheimer type II glia abundant corpora amylacea ischemic foci periventricular encephalitis foci periventricular vascular ectasia and fibrin thrombi SARS CoV RNA was detected with RT PCR in out of and IHC in out patients In a patient that survived a repeat MRI of the brain without contrast agent enhancement showed residual T hyperintensities and hemosiderin deposition in the medial thalami T hyperintensities significantly improved and HEMOSIDERIN DEPOSITION REMAINED UNCHANGED This would indicate that subsequent exposures to the Spike Protein would incrementally increase the amount of iron deposited into the vasculature And how do we know it is Spike The following is very telling SARS CoV spike protein was also detected in cytoplasm of cutaneous dermal vessels and eccrine cells on immune histochemistry IHC of a years old man presenting with acral purpuric macules although his RT PCR was negative As the lesions evolve the color changes to copper red and violaceous due to associated red cell extravasation and then orange brown as a result of HEMOSIDERIN DEPOSITION This Perivascular Hemosiderin Deposition also occurs in MS Where it causes a VASCULITIS Hemosiderin deposition was common in the substantia nigra and other pigmented nuclei in all cases It is concluded that the cerebral vein wall in multiple sclerosis is subject to chronic inflammatory damage which promotes haemorrhage and increased permeability and constitutes a form of vasculitis And the white clots Calcium This may be the answer to them as well The dimeric FXIII A a pro transglutaminase is the catalytic part of the heterotetrameric coagulation FXIII AB complex that upon activation by calcium binding thrombin cleavage covalently cross links preformed fibrin clots protecting them from premature fibrinolysis Note that in COVID a comparison between healthy plasma and acute COVID solubilized clots also showed a significant increase in coagulation factor XIII A chain VWF Complement component C and CRP Yes it is this bad Please stop all the all fear no solutions mantras against me We cannot even begin to find solutions until we know what it is actually doing Eventually we have to reach the bottom of this pit Let s just hope that isn t the discovery that infection or transfection with the Spike Protein of SARS CoV ultimately results in mortality Believe me I do not want to find that You MUST remember HIV starts with a mild flu like illness Stop calling COVD a damn cold And we ABSOLUTELY MUST stop forcing Spike radiol dth s w jev,For those in the medical field and or curious about the true nature of the spike protein whether through Covid or mRNA vaccines here s what we re dealing with It s not a cold The long term implications are very unsettling Fibrosis calcification attack on immune system,1

OTTAWA Ont Justin Trudeau has brokered a deal with the left leaning New Democrats that will keep his minority Liberal government in power until The Canadian prime minister announced Tuesday a formal entente that will see the NDP vote with his Liberal minority government on shared objectives until the House of Commons rises in June Canada s next fixed election date is Oct Is there anything we can do about this apart from waiting for a vote of non confidence How could this even be legal I can t believe we are stuck with this abhorrent coalition with JT until I m also beginning to lose trust in the remainder of the opposition parties From PPC not standing a huge chance to the conservatives with Jean Charest s past and his global affiliation or Pierre Poilievre suspiciously pretending his name never figured on the WEF website when it is archived to the green party or Bloc Quebecois I mean what and this is coming from a Quebecois myself Why does it feel like this was planned for a long time There are so many bills that were attempted to be passed but couldn t because they were a minority government I can t fathom the next level of bullshit we are about to witness with that JustinxJagmeet political marriage thrown on us It s not like we didn t know the NDP was connected with liberal s globalist agenda beforehand but to see it be actualized is another thing Jagmeet and Justin are young WEF leaders puke How are my other fellow Canadians feeling Are we going to witness the full downfall of our country in terms of protection of our rights liberty freedom joy financial and political stability,Trudeau will be prime minister until,1
What do you think about this When we are dreaming everything feels real without questioning it Although our consciousness feels different we never get to the point to realise anything odd except you are a so called lucid dreamer and control your dream which is quite rare as far as I know When we became self aware in the real life here on earth questioning our own reality was a sign of spiritual development Questioning everything that happens in this materialistic world is actually a sign that you are self aware So I ask myself What if living used to be dreaming when we weren t self aware as humans but now became our primary reality Maybe becoming self aware is negative I mean many people report losing their ego on psychedelic drugs and feeling way more real than anything comparable So maybe our dream world is the actual reality while being here on earth should give us a rest from our life So being awake is actually sleeping The conspiracy is very easy to understand Just switch these two realities you know from life and maybe this time you go to bed you will be excited to live again Maybe being awake will become a secondary thing that you don t have too take as serious anymore,The Dream World used to be the dominant reality before we became self aware,1

First a few observations Many urban and suburban communities have the same street names in each town at least around me So one town has First Avenue and it s conveniently located in the same area as the First Avenue in the town next to this town This isn t just two towns it continues on amp xB There are similar named roads in many towns which leads to many things I E First Avenue OR First Street both in the same town Saddle Road OR Saddler Lane both in the same town House numbers are no longer two digits apart odds and evens where I live and there is no construction to warrant the number system here Instead of It can be as many as digits apart however it is usually an even number apart For example Real estate and land owners gt Find stores and or brands to raise the value of the rent paid by other stores brands shops This is also means changes for the local area s If rent is raised so are local prices OR If rent is raised local business is pushed out New tenant will occupy the area For example Pathmark by my house went out of business years ago Eventually a Stew Leonard s replaced it in the same location Many local businesses in the same strip went out of business or were replaced by higher priced businesses They say money talks although they forget inflation and what it does to the economy It may not hit your business or wallet today yet it is slowly affecting it OR someday it will bottom line amp xB What do all these changes mean Is something shady happening in our Nation To our Nation,What s Happening to America,1
Games like COD and Fortnite immediately come to mind Think about the environment of the games It s YOU vs other HUMAN players These games allow you to subconsciously prep for conflict tactically Now obviously pulling a Guns trigger in real life is much more different then in a game environment There re also the psychological damage of taking damage and killing another Human But if you can survive vs other real Humans in COD or Fortnite tactically I d say you are prepared to survive In a real environment Most of the population has zero military Law Enforcement training or Hunting experience But most of the population has picked up a video game controller And if your a man you at some point have probably played a Battle Royale game Look at how fast Ukraine drafted military aged fighting men How exactly are you going to quickly train a drafted population with no military experience You realistically can t since most basic military training courses is longer then weeks time,Battle Royale games are clearly designed to train the public in military tactics for Urban City Scape Battlefronts,1

Sharing my own experience from yesterday I have had to take a rapid covid test in one of those test centers somewhere in Europe This test consists of taking that swab stick and swiping it inside the mouth and sometimes also in the nose After completing the test My mouth felt soar later at home I realized the swab rolling and swiping inside my mouth actually hurt me I was slightly bleeding and had a soar feeling as you usually get when you eat something really hot and burn your self in the mouth I have a feeling that the conspiracy about those swabs actually containing tiny sharp edges which was meant to penetrate the skin for whatever reason is totally real,Covid Rapid test swabs might not be just normal swabs,1
Hear me out here because this is an information war What does Putin seemingly supporting Trump and Tucker Carlson actually prove Do we all of a sudden trust Russia that he actually supports these people or wants Donald trump in office as the democrats say I would say absolutely not If I were in his position I would support the person that I do not want in office and rebuke the one that I do want in office Why Because obviously the right wing people are not going to react in the same way when I say something I know I can get the left to ban censor and destroy anyone that they suspect is a Russian or peddling Russian misinformation Stay chill guys believe nothing,Don t you think Putin is well aware that whatever he says the left wing people in America are the ones who will freak out and act on it,1

I find it hilarious the way Americans are brought up conditioned that suing people over day to day things is normal behaviour I was thinking about this the other evening and can t think of any other place as bad as America where you can get sued for absolutely nothing Watching people get served is mad to me here in the UK to get sued you would have to really fuck up like really massively for someone to even think about it Over there you can be parked in the wrong space and somebody can sue for reasons like blocked my trip to the hospital couldn t get my car out almost died then you are sued for a million dollars That s just an example and maybe not the best one but you know what I mean right Find it amusing people going out about their day then before they know it they have been sued for k because they spilled a bottle of juice in the shop and somebody clams to have slipped on the mess No wonder everybody is hostile and on edge I assumed it was the drugs but could be either or at this point Any you lot been sued over something really stupid or is this normal behaviour to you,Suing culture in America,1

years ago in Leicester England there was a mass demonstration against compulsory vaccination According to Dale L Ross the Times reported the next day Ross pdf gt The widespread opposition to the enforcement of the compulsory clauses of the Vaccination Acts which exists in Leicester culminated yesterday in a great demonstration which was carried out very successfully The position which the inhabitants of the town have assumed with regard to this question is due to a variety of causes At the present moment there are over persons being summoned for refusing to comply with the law The total number of summonses issued in the year only reached seven or a little over one summons in every two months while at the present moment forty five summonses are being heard and disposed of every week The last decade has witnessed an extraordinary decrease in vaccination but nevertheless the town has enjoyed an almost entire immunity from smallpox there never having been more than two or three cases in the town at one time Under such a system the Corporation have expressed their opinion that vaccination is unnecessary as they claim to deal with the disease in a more direct and much more efficacious manner This and a widespread belief that death and disease have resulted from the operation of vaccination may be said to be the foundation upon which the existing opposition to the Act rests According to Alexander Kotok the people of Leicester considered hygiene and sanitation to be a more effective way of opposing the disease gt Leicester residents raised hygiene and sanitation to their shield instead of vaccinations and they were not wrong Leicester also made history with the largest demonstration against compulsory vaccinations held on March which was attended by to people from across England The demonstration was organized by the Anti Vaccination League in response to continued harassment of parents who refused to vaccinate their children in people were facing punishment in Leicester It ended with the burning of Jenner s portrait and a copy of the Mandatory Vaccination Ordinance Totally in Britain the demonstrations against compulsory vaccination took place in cities and towns while in they were held in cities The BBC confirms this information specifying that after the mass compulsory vaccination years later smallpox returned with renewed vigor while in Leicester a city of active anti vaccinationists the death rate from the disease was one of the lowest in all of England gt In October the Leicester Board of Guardians asked the London authorities for an easing of prosecutions in the light of the Leicester method The request was rejected setting the stage for the city s mass protest of gt gt Although peaceful the scale of the demonstration shook the establishment Medical professionals feared for the unvaccinated city predicting a terrible nemesis would overtake it in the shape of a disastrous epidemic gt gt Smallpox duly returned between and And the result shocked many gt gt Leicester actually escaped relatively lightly with cases a rate of cases per of the population resulting in deaths This was a far lower figure of cases than in some well vaccinated towns like Warrington and Sheffield gt gt Anti vaccinationists were triumphant claiming the Leicester method had been proven,years ago in Leicester England there was a mass demonstration against compulsory vaccination,1

before you call me a bot and an operative of the world economic forum do check my name and post history Have you ever thought to yourself The human race would be better off if we as a species were all on the same team I ve had this reoccurring thought since childhood and perhaps it s a childish thought One that neglects the current reality that we live in The reality that the opposing nations of the world will never give up the fight for superiority and the diversification of world governments act like checks and balances for themselves and the whole world as a result In the case of a world government one could argue that there would be no other nations to challenge the world government which could result in an unstoppable global tyrannical enterprise That s the fear and where the objection to such a system is likely to be rooted These fears are fair and legitimate However I believe that a world order of some sort is absolutely inevitable One of these world powers in play has to win the game of thrones It could be a really bad thing but I think it s important to consider that it could be a good thing in many ways The tribal squabbling of our species results in ridiculous losses in life resources and stifles our development as a species altogether The way I see it the inevitable world order that is soon to come will effectively sink or swim our entire species It s either going to be a great leap forward or it s antithesis Regardless of whichever kind of world order we end up being subjected to I think it may be best to just bend over and with assholes wide open just accept it Because what are we really fighting for Not only is it delaying the inevitable but the alternative is to continue on this path of tribalism where the world is at odds with each other To continue fighting wars on the whims of powerful men who aren t risking their lives to fight anything Our current reality and current systems of world governance is obsolete in the face of world unity The world will be unified under a world government for better or for worse A world government would eliminate the concept of war and would put humanity in a much more capable position to advance it s interests as a whole species I know perhaps this is a controversial take but that s what I m here for I would like to hear your thoughts Also try not to go to hard on me I m just talking here,Can a World Order perhaps be a good thing for human civilization,1

This is a love letter of sorrow and grief for all the victims that the Holocaust has claimed According to Rav Rabbi Zev Brenner he claims that as noted by the Zohar a Jewish sacred book whose name means Enlightenment or Splendor the biblical word tashuvu is spelled wrongly because it is written without the letter vav W that should be present within the verb The grammatical error is found specifically in one particular passage of the Bible that has often been interpreted as containing a prophecy regarding the eventual return to their promised land of the Hebrew people You shall return tashuvu every man to his possession every man to his family Leviticus According to Rabbi Benjamin Blech the Gematric numerological value by equating letters with numbers of the word tashuvu is Rabbi Benjamin Blech further notes that tashuvu could also be understood as a year given usual omission as Jewish traditional habit has it of not writing the millennia cypher at the beginning of a number This is claimed by Rabbi Benjamin Blech himself in his book entitled The Secrets of Hebrew words In this case the millennium in which that year would belong to is thus making up the date of which according to Blech corresponds to the year in the standard secular calendar This would correspond still according to the theories of these Rabbis where Zev Brenner cited the more ancient source from Rabbi Blech and corroborated it precisely to the year when Jews were allowed to go back to their land as in the year of the creation of the state of Israel and also the missing vav i e the other vav more precisely since there should be two in the word tashuvu if spelled correctly corresponds to the number since Waw is the sixth letter of the Jewish alphabet All of this still according to Rabbi Blech means that the Jews will be allowed to return to Israel and reclaim sovereignty over their own land in but without the numerical value of the missing letter vav in the word tashuvu return thus equalling to the number of victims that Nazism has claimed in WWII meaning that Jews would be allowed to go back to Israel but without million people What s interesting to note is that the Zohar is considered a fake by a large portion of the Jewish community and is claimed to have composed in modern times so just in case that were the truth it means that the supposed prophecy was also created artificially in relatively recent and or modern times Rabbi Stephen S Wise New York Times June th Edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica New York Times January New York Times November jpg New York Times March jpg New York Times October st html d chinese fansshare com Alternative link The American Jewish Year Handbook New York Times December New York Times May th html July th gif There are many other examples which can be found circulating online When the Czar developed an anti Jewish sentiment in Russia rotten Jewish authorities within the state began a smearing campaign against the Czar monarchy in order to accuse them of antisemitism and organize a revolt against the Russian sovereigns This was done because there was a strict desire by Western bankers stationed in England the US and Europe to take over the Russian economy thus by creating an antisemitic sentiment within Russia itself they had the perfect excuse to subvert the regime and also establish themselves as martyrs and saviors i e freedom fighters because they would use the anti Jewish sentiment to their own advantage and act as victims in order to silently take over the Russian economy But when the Russian revolution ended financed by Western bankers again through sleeper agents such as Lenin and Trotsky outsiders to the Russian regime since Trotsky was a Ukrainian and Lenin was the son of very influential merchants whose ties and family history went back to many different European ancestries and Western countries where the international economy was stationed and from which it operated for a brief overview on who financed Lenin and Trotsky and where their offshore bank accounts were kept Switzerland of course here goes an article from a Ukrainian newspaper the Russians elected their own communist dictator into place who was Stalin and Stalin himself adopted an antisemitic sentiment as predicted that forced Jews to migrate from Russia to other European countries In other words honest and innocent Jews paid the price because their supposed representatives and the ones that should have been protecting their interests and rights acted against them and used them as cover up to infiltrate into Russian society and take it over from within by creating an anti Jewish sentiment increasing the overall situation by blackmailing Russian economy and depriving it of essential goods and food supplies and then use that chaotic situation and also the racist campaign acted upon the Czar because the Czars were depicted as bigoted and antisemitic to infiltrate Russian society undercover place puppet leaders that would stir up the revolution from within because by now they d gained the Russian people s consent as well since according to the official version of events as reported by British and other corrupted European newspapers at the time the starving that the Russian population was going through had been the Czar s fault and they themselves were convinced of it and then escape when the situation became too dire which is why Trotsky was retrieved and made to migrate to the US where he was ultimately killed because no longer useful A similar thing might be happening today with the Zelensky regime and the Ukrainian crisis so eyes open Since Russia had proven itself an unworthy weaponizeable state because of this the prophecy of million Jews could not take place in Russia given the unstable situation that had created itself after the Revolution thus Germany was picked instead where nascent maniacs from the Nazi party were financed by international bankers that had the interest of using them as perpetrators of a genocide observing and studying their racist ideology from the start by flaming it up and increasing it even more over time through their corrupted newspapers and false rumors they had spread about Jews which then played into their hands together with the anti Jewish sentiment that originated from the East when they started the smear campaign against the Czar Then since a self fulfilling prophecy had been artificially created and because it was known already from the turn of the century that million Jews would face peril and eventually die of either starvation war or other means since it was tried in Russia Poland and all over Eastern European countries before as testified by the newspapers reported above these million Jews were displaced mercilessly forced out of their lands in Russia and they were then made to migrate to Germany where along with other German Jews that had already been there for generations they became the victims of the Holocaust so that mentally ill monsters could once again use that as leverage and as an excuse to create the state of Israel i e to benefit their own interests They basically displaced them from their homes in Russia and Eastern Europe and moved them to be killed in Central Europe by then rounding them up and putting them together with other Jews that had already inhabited Central European countries for generations The creation of the state of Israel itself of course had the objective of housing Jews at large who escaped from the horrors of Nazism and this was done so that their puppet masters would appear as benevolent and and merciful lords who care about Jews at large and are overall sensitive towards human catastrophes but the true strategical meaning of the state of Israel was to split the Middle East in two because they knew exactly that Arab culture would never accept Israel and the Israelite population as legitimate so in order to create tension between the two worlds and also as a strategic position towards the Middle East because the war in Middle Eastern countries had already been planned ahead of time since there was the intention of taking over the rich economy of those resource filled states and also to erase their history the nation of Israel was thus conceived The fact that the war in the Middle East was already planned from the start might smell as nonsensical and conspiratorial but if one simply observes the pattern that these psychotic and mentally deficient individuals have adopted throughout recent history it would become pretty clear why the war in the Middle East and the splitting of the Muslim world could have been premeditated from the start since they first took over Russia because Russia at the time was one of if not the biggest commercial power in the civilized world controlled by the Czar and the Czars also had ties with the German world because the monarchies were inbred and related to each other So by destroying the Romanov dynasty and making it so that all the industrial resources and commercial prowess owned by the Czars would become of the state i e of the puppet state leaders that replaced the monarchy once the Russian revolution was done they were then basically bought and or owned directly as well as indirectly by Western rich people banks that thus divided and conquered the economic influence of Russia into Europe The same had been done in Germany where local German factories of manufacture railroads the first transportation systems of history and handiwork in general became owned by Western bankers who bankrupted Germany from within since many of them were german at the time and also from the outside through the circulation of false information with newspapers coming from the US and England mainly owned by Western bankers thus being corrupt news outlets and they bought off all of these European enterprises for very low prices So they conquered Russia economically even though they couldn t fully since Russia responded by electing a maniac such as Stalin that made relations with Russia difficult and so it was better off to isolate Russia completely from the European world because of the mess that Western bankers had left after the Bolshevik revolution within Russian society itself they then conquered Germany and this way also France Italy Austria by revolutionizing the banking systems since the monarchies at the time had made their own countries go bankrupt because of continuous wars so they used that to their own advantage by creating private banks and then they became so powerful to be able to bankrupt the nations themselves if they wished to because they also controlled the British economy in England Thus here goes a list Europe that is mainly comprised of due to the importance of these countries and their respective economies in the scheme of things Germany France Italy Britain Austria then Russia then the United States of America and all rich countries of the world have been conquered what s left logically The Middle East Arab countries because they are among the richest due to their resources Russia completely since they did it in the s but when Vladimir Putin was elected the corrupted oligarchs that were controlled by Western bankers and acted as infiltrated spies into the Russian economy were kept on leash by Putin who was thus able to buy back most of the enterprise and manufacture that Russia had lost since the Bolshevik Revolution and also during the Cold War after Stalin s death and the election of western backed and one should say also corrupted or at least weak minded and easily controllable Boris Yeltsin and then finally once all of this is done gain monopoly over the Asian market as well So that s why the war in the Middle East had already been staged because it was the next logical step to total world domination through the economy of nations by gaining control of the richest and most influential countries in the world and owing their economies The accountability for such actions could potentially be traced back if one follows the money to the usual names that pop up all over the internet of very powerful and influential people first and foremost one should simply check to whom the Balfour Declaration was addressed when writing the formal letter and also here goes another letter from Heinrich Br ning Chancellor of Germany from to who claimed that I didn t and do not even today for understandable reasons wish to reveal from October the two largest regular contributors to the Nazi Party were the general managers of two of the largest Berlin banks both of Jewish faith and one of them the leader of Zionism in Germany cit in Theodore J O Keefe in Dismantling Churchillian Mythology and Institute for Historical Review also known as The Journal of Historical Review in Vol VII n pp sgg The letter is currently preserved as part of the Longwell collection Butler library at the Columbia University in New York The Zionists had legitimate interests in saving the Jewish people and giving them a rightful land but they were manipulated and used by more powerful people who passed themselves off as friends of the Jews and also as Zionist sympathizers because they were Jews themselves and the objective of creating the land of Israel was put into place as a covertly strategical move to benefit the powerful forces behind its funding not the better interests of the Jewish community I find it imperative that a thorough investigation be launched regarding the accountability for such psychotic nature of these sadistic crimes first and foremost in the loving name and sad memory of all the victims of the Holocaust whose names shall never be forgotten and that bring pain to all our hearts and secondly for all free people that are afflicted nowadays one way or another from the parasitic element of society that has controlled them for far too long This is a type of monstrosity the likes of which have never been seen in the history of humanity Freedom to the Jewish people,Justice for Jewish people,1

This is why I think the cyberattack will not shut down the internet It will target critical infrastructure instead People will need to feed the fear machine and share their horror stories online for social validation Also furthering propaganda I think the best aspects of the internet have been controlled and now it s becoming a detriment to society I recently went a whole week without using the internet social media one exception was email and I feel so much better my mind is clearer I am more observant and have started to see the good in people again I don t get distracted while reading a book and I notice I am sleeping better My anxiety and depression are still there but I seem to be more successful at putting them into perspective not allowing them to control my thoughts constantly Overall I feel more like myself for lack of a better way of putting it It s like getting myself off drugs This cyberattack will create enough panic that people will freak out but it won t completely cut off communications I don t think so anyway Because right now it s too convenient of a propaganda tool,A cyberattack that took down the internet long term would be the greatest thing to happen to humanity in a long time,1

A NASA engineer for years Hunkeler contributed to the the Apollo missions in s and even patented a technology that allowed space shuttle panels to tolerate excessive heat When he was a teenager family members reported noticing strange phenomenon in Hunkeler s wake according to the magazine Skeptical Inquirer As he moved across a room chairs around him scattered Hunkeler s family minster wrote to the Parapsychology Laboratory at Duke University His bed claimed Rev Luther Schulze rattled when he lay down on it After a series of medical and psychological tests failed to find anything out of the ordinary his family appealed to religious elders The family was Lutheran and they went through all the stages you see in the film They went to doctors clinics and finally went back to their own pastor in the Lutheran church who recommended they see a priest William Friedkin director of the Exorcist told Entertainment Weekly in Eventually they sought the help of William Bowdern a Jesuit who would perform at least exorcisms on the teen in a span of three months Bowdern s diary describes the boy entering a trance like state in front of more than dozen witnesses during one exorcism Hunkeler was eventually taken to St Louis to expel the evil spirits said to inhabit him On one evening the word Louis was written on the boy s ribs in deep red scratches Next when there was some question of the time of departure the word Saturday was written plainly on the boy s hip wrote Bowdern As to the length of time the mother and boy should stay in St Louis another message was printed on the boy s chest weeks The printing always appeared without any motion on the part of the boy s hands The mother was keeping him under close supervision In all except the last of these exorcisms the boy broke into a violent tantrum of screaming cursing and voicing of Latin phrases a language he had never studied whenever the priest reached the climactic point of the ritual In the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost I cast thee the devil out a Washington Post article quotes Father Raymond Bishop a Catholic priest as saying,Inspiration for the movie The Exorcist has been identified as former NASA engineer,1

I see a lot of convoluted posts about celebs regarding Hollywood and satanism from people who ve done Zero research and have regurgitated Qanon crap they read off Twitter Couple of things Satanism in Hollywood is not prevalent Sinister Occultism is This revolves around occult movements the order of the Golden Dawn Thelema and the Worship of Moloch It takes about years to rise through the ranks of Thelema and Golden Dawn You can usually identify them by the suspicious deaths of their family members NOTHING IS FREE There s a sacrifice for that amazing life The Moloch one goes back a few thousand years and is passed down through affluent wealthier bloodlines For the love of god no one drinks blood It s taken as a sacrament like you see Catholics sipping wine at the alter It s literally a freakin table spoon Blood drinking is Qanon bullshit Children No one eats children There is something called SRA Satanic Ritual Abuse but it s not prevalent in Hollywood Pedophelia is a BIG Hollywood thing but has nothing to do with occult rituals it s a very small offshoot You need to be able to separate the two When Hollywood celebs fuck kids it s because they are sexual deviants and can get away with it not everything is related to the occult related See Corey Feldman stories Usually higher degree Freemasons who happen to be Celebs take part in this degrees There are very few of these Also female Witches from the Order of the Eastern Star will take part in pedophelic rituals but at degrees Babies No one is eating babies They are sacrificing them This is a Moloch Occult ritual Sacrifice They believe your career takes off after or you keep getting more greater opportunities These babies are either farmed by groomed mothers very small offshoot less than individuals in the continental United States or they get them from the Neo Natal Intensive Care Unit of Washington DC It s funded by your obvious presidential candidate and it s visitor list will show you all your favorite musicians basketball players Washington DC Politicians and A list actors It houses babies with birth defects given up by their mothers for various reasons or on life support Lastly deal with it We have fucked up people on this planet who believe weird shit It is what it is Let s all do more research and share accurate information,Truth about Hollywood,1

c A Spectacular Example of Precognitive Remote Viewing Carried out by Joe McMoneagle in September Mission Spy satellite photographs had shown suspicious heavy construction activity around a building located meters from a large body of water somewhere in northern Russia The National Security Council NSC wanted to know what was going on there Assignment Joe was given only the geographical coordinates latitude and longitude and asked to describe the site When Joe said it was a cold location near a body of water with large buildings and smoke stacks etc NSC was satisfied that he was probably at the right site They then showed him the satellite photograph in their possession and asked him to find out what was going on inside the building Joe said The interior is very large and noisy active working area full of scaffolding girders and blue flashes probably arc welding He took a break and continued in another session Probably a huge submarine under construction Draws a sketch with dimensions etc A long flat deck strangely angled missile tubes about to in number A new type of mechanism to drive the submarine nuclear powered a double hull At this point the NSC representatives figured that Joe must be wrong because if what he said was true it would be the world s biggest submarine No US intelligence agency had ever heard of it The US did not possess a submarine this large Besides who would build a submarine in a building so far from water How would they launch it But since Joe had acquired the reputation of being very accurate NSC asked him to view the future and find out when it would be launched Joe scanned the future month by month and said the Russians would blast a channel to connect the building with the body of water and launch the submarine in four months Confirmation In January exactly as predicted by Joe spy satellite pictures confirmed the launching of the world s biggest submarine after construction of an artificlal channel connecting the building to the water It had missile tubes a large flat deck etc exactly as described by Joe There are many more backed up documents even of people remote viewing other planets We humans can do more with our body and mind but the government has turned it off by using radiofrequenties and poisoning our food and water Just look at our history the piramides and many other buildings and structures that where made with precision we cant even manage with modern equipment All those drawings of humans doing extraordinary things Are humans turned off by governments in there use of abilities,Remote viewing,1
Hey Hey first time poster this is Galen Winsor He is demonstrating how Uranium is not dangerous by ingesting it the implication is that nuclear radiation is a myth and nuclear bombs are a hoax Hiroshima and Nagasaki were fire bombed according to local Japanese reporting at the time The two cities were not even in the top most destroyed cities after World War Nuvlear fallout did not happen Those cities were quickly rebuilt and reinhabited after allegedly being bombed by nukes Only one reporter in the states was allowed to report on those bombings at the time under the threat of treason and Japan didn t surrender until hours later why did they wait so long to surrender Because it wasn t the fear of nukes that motivated them it was Russia breaking their non aggression treaty entering the war and invading Manchuria Once Japan realized that Russia was on our side that s when they decided to give up Nukes are a myth Thoughts,Nukes are fake,1

In fact every religion has accepted death as inevitable yet after reading the bible I can see it is very much about defeating death and an intention for humans to live forever It talks about how Jesus came and defeated death and those who simply believed that he did so can live forever Yet I have rarely if ever heard a Christian preach this or confess this stance against death Many old people who are Christian embrace death in old age saying they want to die to be in heaven especially if they believe they lived a life as a believer in God and regularly asked for forgiveness I see verses like God is a God of the a living and not of the dead or no man goes to heaven except he who came down for heaven Or talks of the white throne judgement and how the sea and earth had dead inside them that were released to attend the judgement after which those judged for what they had done on earth while alive were either sent to the lake of fire with the devil and his fallen angels to and endless torment or they were given a new incorruptible body to live in a new city that had came down from heaven to earth while the former heaven and earth were destroyed The bible talks about how Jesus went to prepare many mansions for his followers which were new body s and how the believers among the living would transform in the twinkling of an eye to an incorruptible body When I bring this up to Christian s they all say I ve twisted the scripture and they still won t give up the idea of dying and going to heaven When the bible talks about all who die either good or bad went to the same grave It talks about some prophets like Elias and Moses who died but their bodies were not found by Satan who searched the world for them when hearing they had died but couldn t find them It talks about the original intention for the first humans to live forever but they instead learned about the existence of death and it entered the world through sin It says that humans were the reason death came to earth and eventually began to reduce their life It talked about how God even promised his people to live to years of age at least after this had happened And then later when Jesus came Jesus raised the dead and preached about defeating death and how now it was possible to live forever Yet I hear no Christian s preaching immortality or believing in what Jesus accomplished or believing in living forever It talks In the bible about how souls are immortal and people use this to support their believe well they will die and be immortal in heaven But it literally says his followers and believers should not see death not die and live forever it says how all souls are eternal but the breath of life returns to God when those souls died and the soul goes to the spirit hell where it is held in the grave until the white throne judgment It says this about all souls that die except the martyrs and the apostles and a few prophets where are being held under an alter until the white throne judgment and they are even calling to God asking how long It talks about how a a rich man and begged both died but the beggars body was taken by God and the rich man cried out to a prophet asking for the prophet to warn his brothers not to die or to repent and the prophet replied that they wouldn t believe him even if he warned them I see many many places how God says he will do nothing in the world except reveal his secrets to his servants the prophets I see it say that God says many even pray wrong it just seems that all Christian s of all denominations don t even go by the bible that not a single so called Christian has this information when it s in the bible or they just ignore it and preach their own stories or a different version of it,Christians have it all wrong and the Catholics even more so The bible and Living forever not dying and going to heaven or hell Christiany is anti death preaching immortality,1

I watched the first episode and I find it hard to believe that show was not made with the intention of popularizing a puppet they could make president The series begins with some billionaires conspiring about rigging the presidential elections The show is about a school teacher going viral for a political rant and ends up becoming president They even do a gag where he takes PR pictures in front of different green screen sets That shit looked identical to the green screen Zalensky used over the weekend A Make show with your actual plan B Show becomes popular C Create political party from the show and cite popularity of the show D Use that character to convince the world to start WW This is not a show someone made to tell a story This was made to engineer themselves a puppet An actor by definition is a puppet Show is decently well made and Zalensky is a decent comedy actor I can see how his charm makes him popular This dude is just Stephen Colbert with a presidential career,Has anyone watched Servant of the People,1

I tried to share this post but maybe describing more then I should and not looking for unwanted attention But ended my post with this that I find the most unique Is that you can live your whole life wondering if they are spying on you only to find your self living right beside the other side So I wanted to update my post because I wanted to hear from others who have recognized they live beside a government worker and what kind of weird things they noticed,Possible that I live beside a government agent,1
I feel like if all the sex trafficking rings were exposed it would reveal the people facilitating like of all conspiracies Only the richest and most powerful people can engage in this kind of behavior and not get caught If Epstein s sick buddies were just some upper middle class blokes they would have all been caught by now,Sex traffickers will never be exposed,1
Nothing to serious of a conspiracy just really odd as someone who has studied this field of information now for plus years The landlord name is Rick He s a older white man Myself am also a white man with bi racial children and my x being black We live in Los Angeles I am not sure what strikes me so odd about the landlord but he makes me think of someone that is likely racist but will accept money from anyone I could be completely wrong He seems more of that generation where as the one I am from is much more urban I am from the south so I have learned to recognize the difference I noticed that he was a Freemason recently when I seen the logo on the back of his car like I ve seen others have Then one day I noticed that one of his two motorcycles is Freemason themed Never seen anything painted in such fashion There is a all seeing eye like the dollar bill Today I am not sure why I hadn t seen until now but his license plate are blank as far as requiring registration I believe this indicates sometime of working service to the government He doesn t interact with my x and our kids in any way that s a bother I don t think my x has paid any attention to these observations It s funny when you live your whole life thinking that they are spying on you and then eventually you find yourself living right beside the otherside willingly,Possibly my x wife landlord is a government agent,1

I thought I would bring a subject back about the shipping containers in shipping ports around the world The Evergreen Shipping Company and other companies have had multiple problems with their ships getting stuck as well as being on coast of the US Australia and other countries Are there truly weapons of mass destruction onboard of these ships that have been caught in Child Trafficking and carrying large amounts of weapons drugs and people And do you think they are there to protect the people or destroy the people Because they appear to be a front for Government groups like the CIA Military and countries around the world And I m curious if you can add to this or what your thoughts are regarding these things html,Shipping Containers Child Trafficking Weapons of Mass Destruction and More,1

I d like to talk about some conspiracies on here though I do enjoy the news relayed here lately This may sound dumb but I have a feeling the elites goals go beyond just earthly power While this is an excellent motivator I feel there is some other aspect to all of this from what I ve seen over the years and researched Yet I fall flat on the part of what the exact end goal is Enslavement of humanity and a one world government sure but what is the goal beyond that What entity do they wish to please I know there are many Christians on here who will spam its Satan they worship and to repent but frankly I think that s not it They are clearly into esoteric teachings and Magick but what do they wish to do and why do you think we exist here,what do you think the elites goal is beyond world domination,1

My husband had a pretty bad reaction after J amp J last year He was sick for two weeks with chest pain shortness of breath and a fever We were going to try the CICP program Countermeasure Injury Compensation Program to see if we could get help with the hefty hospital bill we were left with Not likely but worth a try I guess Called the hospital to get a medical record of what happened to file with our claim Turns out instead of putting down that he had a reaction to the vaccine they put exposed to covid I m sorry what They didn t even test him for covid They DID do numerous tests like CT scan and a chest x ray to check for a blood clot So basically now we can t file with the CICP unless they adjust the medical record The lady I spoke to said this has happened a lot lately Anyone experience something like this,My experience with hospital possibly inflating covid numbers,1
I ve shown in here links pdf video of what the other side says and presents while no one dares to even look A report that was conducted by a non state org talking about the Torture pro Russians endure from the Ukrainian military pdf Based on the information collected by the Foundation a clear conclusion can be drawn that most of the torture victims are not members of the Donetsk or Lugansk People s Republics self defense forces but civilians A reason for arrest and torture of civilians by the Ukrainian side can be as simple as involvement in anti Euromaidan rallies participation in Russian TV shows expression of your opinion on the Internet involvement in pro DPR rallies participation in the referendum possession of a telephone number of a Russian journalist Caucasian names Aslan Uzbek in the personal phone contacts a phone conversation with people from the Donetsk People s Republic receiving medical assistance in the DPR etc The same absurdity and lack of substantial evidence is characteristic of the other accusations pdf EXTREMELY GRAPHIC FOR FIRST PAGES This is a interesting read many things are referenced and have links I will say that many of these links are Russian sites so I guess take it with a grain of salt but nonetheless a interesting read In March Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov announced that the Azov Battalion would be one of the first units to be trained by US Army forces as part of their Operation Fearless Guard training mission However U S training was discontinued on June as the U S House of Representatives passed an amendment banning any assistance including weaponry and training to the battalion due to its neo Nazi background After the vote a member of Congress John Conyers thanked the House of Representatives saying I am grateful that last night the House of Representatives unanimously passed my amendments to ensure that our military will not train members of the disgusting neo Nazi Azov Battalion as well as my measures to prevent dangerous and easily accessible MANPADS to this unstable region French Journalist documenting citizens of Donbas This is a hour long documentary of what the citizens have to say from what they ve experienced since Extremely sad,Ukrainian War Crimes and other things you don t hear about,1
I ve always been interested in conspiracies and alternative theories I ve never found the conspiracy community for lack of a better descriptor to be particularly partisan in one direction or the other There s a conspiracy for almost every major event and every major political historical figure But I m a bit surprised at the obvious political bias in this subreddit Off hand I d say it s between right wingers and apolitical folks Has this group just been taken over by conspiratorial republicans or do you think that liberals just aren t as inclined to be conspiracy minded I don t believe that s true personally I m genuinely trying to figure this subreddit out because the political slant here is obvious that I feel like it s almost just another GOP group,Trying to understand why this sub is so partisan,1
This article is talking about another article that I remembered reading years ago The original article is long scrubbed I m guessing sadly but this sums it up well It seemed absolutely crazy and definitely fake to me at the time but now The guy mentioned in this article can be found easily on Instagram and IMDB and he does seem a very shady character I would ve probably dismissed the article like I did years ago if it wasn t for this reference to this obscure oligarch I love Brittany Murphy and I doubt we will ever know what truly happened to her and I really hope it s a hell of a lot more mundane than this version of events Gazetaru Brittany Murphy bawila w Moskwie The newspaper reports that the actress was in Moscow before her death visiting the Russian oligarch The newspaper reports that the actress was in Moscow before her death visiting the Russian oligarch According to the newspaper Brittany Murphu who died unexpectedly played at a closed party in the private estate of Igor Dyyatnikov a businessman producer and singer near Moscow Another Hollywood celebrity Milla Jovovich was to attend the same party with her Gazeta ru refers to other participants of the game It is not known exactly when Murphy flew from Moscow to Los Angeles Without a change the plane covers this route in approximately hours Hollywood star Brittany Murphy died on December at her home in Los Angeles Only year old actress suffered from a massive heart attack However the media reported on the actress s troubles with cocaine and her abuse of painkillers Supposedly the kind that caused Michael Jackson s death Who is mister D Igor Diesiatnikov is a well known oligarch and showman in Russia He was the owner of one of the leading banks However in the bank s license was revoked for failing to comply with federal credit regulations The oligarch is also well known in the world of Russian show business He is a producer but also tries to perform on stage in the popular genre of Russian chance Diesiatnikov is also an actor admittedly mainly in films that he finances himself In he played inter alia in the movie You and I starring the group Tatu and the American star Mischa Barton Igor Diesiatnikov himself denied media reports about the party and acquaintance with actresses Britanna Murphy and Milla Jovovich,Brittany Murphy Russian connection,1

In our understanding of nukes and quantum energy when an atom is split it creates some sort of event horizon and energy is present in more than one dimension there s unexplained energy loss in an atomic explosion and this is an explanation I made up for it So what if God rather than being the great architect was just some weiner who manipulated the universe made by the actual great architect to get a spiritual and material world going on where he could be god over the material realm from the spiritual realm Well all that worked fine until man actually split the atom The lost energy crossed dimensions and went into the spirit realm Where it blew it up or at least screwed up God and all the angels and demons playing spirits and manipulating the physical realm Since mankind has actually gotten become more peaceful and prosperous than any time in humanities existence Fewer people live a subsistence lifestyle and people have a longer life with less chance of dying from war famine or disease than ever What if that s because the nuclear energy decimated the spirit realm and killed off the so called God who has been terrorizing humanity since the dawn of time,So what if nukes are real and they blew up the spiritual realm,1

So I was scrolling through Twitter today and found this picture comparing John Lennon to Steve Jobs It intrigued me and then as I dug into things a little bit on my own I realized that John Lennon had no funeral he was cremated and his ashes scattered and the two new singles that became huge after his death were Starting Over and Double Fantasy I didn t have to look much further to find other intriguing facts such as Forbes wrote an article after Job s passing comparing the legacies of the two men The title was Steve Jobs John Lennon sh efac sh efac Both men s biographies describe an odd year hiatus from about which is when John Lennon was murdered and Steve Jobs came onto the scene There are reports of Steve Jobs visiting Yoko Ono in to give Sean Lennon an Apple Computer for his th birthday party Apparently Andy Warhol was at the gathering as well sh d sh d There are interviews of the murderer of John Lennon Mark David Chapman that have a weird vibe plus the whole Catcher in the Rye situation with the killing just seems scripted and weird tAR B U U IIBOiRapk IIBOiRapk Mark David Chapman is described in Brittanica com as spending time at Fort Chaffee Arkansas as a counselor for Vietnamese refugees yeah right lol Anyone want to do some digging on this It has been a fun distraction from my usual we re all going to die conspiracy theorizing lately I look forward to any replies P S I know there are sinister reasons behind this and everything it s just less direct and soul crushing than so many theories out there Hope everyone is well Thanks,John Lennon Steve Jobs,1
Did some basic math and the descent of the plane that could cause it to fall ft in a min wud have been anywhere between the conditions angle to the ground if it flew at its max speed of around mph Either that or if it was flying straight down the entire time at an average speed of mph since it was flying straight down in the video it seems as if there was zero thrust so the engines were cut but the plane was also fully yawed back jet airliner can not fly fully yawed back due to obvious design constraints This plane was aimed straight to the ground and reports will show in coming days,Further proof the plane was aimed straight into the ground,1

Ghosts and spirits have been reported as far as back as Ancient Greece Rome Egypt China North American and Pacific cultures Even in the last years to now there s been THOUSANDS of sightings recorded documents imagery recreations vivid explanations lie detecter tests and videos Yet they re not classified as real because simply because scientists say that science cannot prove that they re real nor science cannot prove they re not real Most people have had a spiritual experience especially during childhood and those who have not usually have one when they have children of their own or when they re elderly What s your opinion on this Do you believe in ghosts spirits,Why are ghosts spirits not real if there s almost tens of thousands of personal evidence and sightings throughout human history What do you believe,1

I completely came up with this randomly and idk if anyone has posted something similar beforehand so take this lightly From my perspective the universe is full of loops My theory is that civilizations will form on different planets and different times After civilizations have advanced enough and have depleted their natural resources on the planet they move to different planets or even galaxies These different civilizations could exist in the millions all over our galaxy Some may be so far away from us that they might not even know us humans exist Another part of this theory of mine is that ancient ruins or things we cannot explain are the leftovers from another civilization formed on earth millions of years ago Hell these more advanced civilizations could be spying on us and certain government officials are aware and keep it secret,The infinite theory,1

Now that Hunter s laptop story was confirmed it s a matter of time until this gets a bigger proportion and more intense mainstream coverage We reached a point where Biden has become a problem or no longer useful to the globalist agenda as well as his son Apart from getting him out of the game either by assassination or impeachment they want to distract people from Hunter s filth So I d expect some escalation in the next following days I think Alex Jones was saying an assassination plot against Biden during his trip to Europe was possible so we might want to look at that as it would remove Biden and drag our focus back to war again But it could be a cyberattack too I just think the Hunter s laptop and his businesses in Ukraine are not what the globalists want people to know about,The pedo elite will come up with the next big thing soon,1

I read a post on here about a redditor trying to withdraw cash and the bank pushing a digital wallet on him and it reminded me of something similar that happened to me a few weeks ago For the same reason as the other guy I decided that I wanted to have some cash on me in the event that the major financial systems were hacked or went down for whatever reason So I walked into my major nationwide bank on a Friday morning and was intercepted by an employee not a bank teller before I could approach the window She asked what I was there for and I told her I would like to withdraw a few thousand dollars from my account Before the words could escape my mouth she was shaking her head no She then went on to tell me that they didn t have that amount at any of the branches in my town She asked if I could use a cashier s check but not wanting to let on why I was withdrawing money I told her that I would prefer to have the cash So I asked if I could place an order to pick up the following week but was told it would take two weeks to get my money again just a few thousand dollars Shocked but remaining calm I agreed and provided my name and number for her to call me in two weeks when it was ready About hours later I received a call from the bank telling me they had my money I then drove back to the bank where the teller already had the exact amount wrapped up with my name and number on the wrapper I realize that they could have possibly had a lot of deposits during the day and eventually had enough cash for my withdrawal but I also couldn t help but feel like I was part of the social credit system we all speak and read about on this sub and that I was denied cash to provide them enough time to do a background check on me check my social media accounts whatever to make sure that it was safe to give me MY OWN money After all what bank doesn t have a few thousand dollars on hand at any given time,Tried to withdraw cash but major bank lied and told me they didn t have any,1

suppressing this information so as to keep people uninformed or misinformed as to their true nature cite note According to King the Silence Group uses fear and ignorance to control humanity Theosophy I really recommend reading the full wiki As presented by Blavatsky Theosophy teaches that there is an ancient and secretive brotherhood of spiritual adepts known as the Masters who although found around the world are centered in Tibet These Masters are alleged by Blavatsky to have cultivated great wisdom and supernatural powers and Theosophists believe that it was they who initiated the modern Theosophical movement through disseminating their teachings via Blavatsky They believe that these Masters are attempting to revive knowledge of an ancient religion once found around the world and which will again come to eclipse the existing world religions Theosophical groups nevertheless do not refer to their system as a religion Theosophy preaches the existence of a single divine Absolute philosophy It promotes an emanationist cosmology in which the universe is perceived as outward reflections from this Absolute Theosophy teaches that the purpose of human life is spiritual emancipation and claims that the human soul Theosophy undergoes reincarnation upon bodily death according to a process of karma It promotes values of universal brotherhood and social improvement although it does not stipulate particular ethical codes The Masters Central to Theosophical belief is the idea that a group of spiritual adepts known as the Masters not only exist but were responsible for the production of early Theosophical texts cite note FOOTNOTECampbell For most Theosophists these Masters are deemed to be the real founders of the modern Theosophical movement cite note FOOTNOTECampbell In Theosophical literature these Masters are also referred to as the Mahatmas Adepts Masters of Wisdom Masters of Compassion and Elder Brothers cite note FOOTNOTECampbell They are perceived to be a

life spans cite note FOOTNOTECampbell and to have gained supernatural powers including clairvoyance and the ability to instantly project their soul out of their body to any other location The Masters are believed to preserve the world s ancient spiritual knowledge cite note FOOTNOTECampbell and to represent a Great White Brotherhood or White Lodge which watches over humanity and guides its evolution Book of Enoch talks about hybrid angels and humans and the world was filled with sin violence depravity these hybrid angels sound a lot like hybridized aliens humans which looks like its currently happening today again I believe we were under control of these aliens a long time ago and now they re seeking to control us again Tom Delonge talked about how Atlantis might of been real and how they might of fought back and got destroyed and here in Theosophy At this point the fourth Root Race appeared living on the continent of Atlantis they had physical bodies but also psychic powers and advanced technology cite note FOOTNOTECampbell E Lachman She claimed that some Atlanteans were giants and built such ancient monuments as Stonehenge in southern England and that they also mated with she animals resulting in the creation of gorillas and chimpanzees cite note FOOTNOTELachman The Atlanteans were decadent and abused their power and knowledge so Atlantis sunk into the sea although various Atlanteans escaped and created new societies in Egypt and the Americas Previous control Besant and Leadbeater claimed to be able to investigate people s past lives through reading the akashic record an etheric store of all the knowledge of the universe cite note FOOTNOTEPoller They for instance claimed to have attained knowledge of their own past lives as monkey like creatures residing on the moon where they served as pets to the Moon man a prior incarnation of the Master Morya his wife Koot Humi and their child the Lord Maitreya When they were attacked by savages and animals resembling furry lizards and crocodiles Besant sacrificed herself to save Morya and for that act made the karmic evolutionary leap to becoming a human in her next incarnation cite note FOOTNOTEPoller E Deities in ancient Mesopotamia were almost exclusively anthropomorphic cite note FOOTNOTEBlackGreen They were thought to possess extraordinary powers cite note FOOTNOTEBlackGreen and were often envisioned as being of tremendous physical size cite note FOOTNOTEBlackGreen The deities typically wore melam an ambiguous substance which covered them in terrifying splendor cite note FOOTNOTEBlackGreen E Melam could also be worn by heroes kings giants and even demons cite note FOOTNOTEBlackGreen E The effect that seeing a deity s melam has on a human is described as ni a word for the physical tingling of the flesh Crowley Occultist Aleister Crowley contacted an alien gray alien named lam htm htm Vall e proposes that there is a genuine UFO phenomenon partly associated with a form of non human consciousness that manipulates space and time The phenomenon has been active throughout human history and seems to masquerade in various forms to different cultures In his opinion the intelligence behind the phenomenon attempts social manipulation by using deception on the humans with whom they interact Vall e also proposes that a secondary aspect of the UFO phenomenon involves human manipulation by humans Witnesses of UFO phenomena undergo a manipulative and staged spectacle meant to alter their belief system and eventually influence human society by suggesting alien intervention from outer space The ultimate motivation for this deception is probably a projected major change of human society the breaking down of old belief systems and the implementation of new ones Vall e states that the evidence if carefully analyzed suggests an underlying plan for the deception of mankind by means of unknown highly advanced methods Vall e states that it is highly unlikely that governments actually conceal alien evidence as the popular myth suggests Rather it is much more likely that that is exactly what the manipulators want us to believe Vall e feels the entire subject of UFOs is mystified by charlatans and science fiction He advocates a stronger and more serious involvement of science in the UFO research and debate C Ae cite note Only this can reveal the true nature of the UFO phenomenon Musicians famous celebrities with a lot of pull trying to get people to contact them such as Demi lovato Lovato continued Over the past couple months I have dug deep into the science of consciousness and experienced not only peace and serenity like I ve never known but I also have witnessed the most incredibly profound sightings both in the sky as well as feet away from me This planet is on a very negative path towards destruction but WE can change that together If we were to get of the population to meditate and make contact we would force our governments to acknowledge the truth about extraterrestrial life among us and change our destructive habits destroying our planet This is just some of the evidence from under the stars in the desert sky that can no longer be ignored and must be shared immediately Blavatsky taught that Lord Maitreya a figure she borrowed from Buddhist mythology would come to Earth as a messianic figure cite note FOOTNOTEPoller Her ideas on this were expanded upon by Besant and Leadbeater cite note FOOTNOTEPoller They claimed that Maitreya had previously incarnated onto the Earth as Krishna a figure from Hindu mythology cite note FOOTNOTEPoller They also claimed that he had entered Jesus of Nazareth at the time of the latter s baptism and that henceforth Maitreya would be known as the Christ According to Blavatsky s teachings many of the world s religions have their origins in a universal ancient religion a secret doctrine that was known to Plato and early Hindu sages and which continues to underpin the center of every religion cite note FOOTNOTECampbell She promoted the idea that ancient societies exhibited a unity of science and religion that humanity has since lost with their achievements and knowledge being far in excess of what modern scholars believe about them cite note FOOTNOTECampbell Blavatsky also taught that a secret brotherhood has conserved this ancient wisdom religion throughout the centuries and that members of this fraternity hold the key to understanding miracles the afterlife and psychic phenomena and that moreover these adepts themselves have paranormal powers Blavatsky She was contacted by aliens at birth and had supernatural abilities reading thoughts etc In London Blavatsky founded a magazine controversially titling it Lucifer magazine Ballard The young man later identified himself as the Count of St Germain Germain Ballard provided details of his encounters with St Germain and other Ascended Masters in the books Unveiled Mysteries and The Magic Presence using the pen name Godfr Ray King Guy Ballard his wife Edna and their son Edona Eros Donald Ballard claimed to be the sole accredited messengers of Saint Germain Their teachings constitute the original nucleus of what are today called the Ascended Master Teachings and are still used in I AM Sanctuaries all over the world cite note Before Christ s second coming the Church must pass through a final trial that will shake the faith of many believers The persecution that accompanies her pilgrimage on earth will unveil the mystery of iniquity in the form of a religious deception offering men an apparent solution to their problems at the price of apostasy from the truth The supreme religious deception is that of the Antichrist a pseudo or false messianism by which man glorifies himself in

depraved because of these half giant angels humans and Theosophy talks about in ancient times there were giants Book of Enoch also talks about how angels taught humans how to make stuff for war industry other things and magic sorcery similar to how its happening today It also talks about how the giants forced humans to be enslaved and that the human spirits of those slain cried out to god and other stuff I recommend you read it HTM HTM Tom Delonge said these aliens are evil and are based on consciousness and that we shouldn t be trying to contact them and that there were giants in the old days I believe these aliens want to reestablish their dominancy like it was in the book of enoch and enslave us once more When God sent that flood to wipe out everything it appears the good aliens

By yiannis varoufakis Greek politician At a time when Russian bombs are destroying Ukrainian cities there is good reason to focus on the oligarchs supporting the Kremlin But do American multi billionaires and Saudi princes enjoy less political clout stash less money abroad and use their influence any better ATHENS No sooner had Roman Abramovich newly targeted by the United Kingdom s sanctions on Russian oligarchs announced that he was selling Chelsea Football Club than the feeding frenzy began An athletics icon City grandees and even a respected Times columnist each representing different American multi billionaires descended on London in a race to buy the club Meanwhile a host of London properties belonging to Russian oligarchs entered a long overdue process of liquidation What took so long To put it bluntly the West s legal foundations True Western leaders encouraged the inflows David Cameron then UK Prime Minister appealed in to a Moscow audience to invest in Britain But it wasn t hard to convince the oligarchs to flood London with their money Western countries legislation prevents governments and the public not only from disturbing wealth stored in their jurisdictions but also from even knowing where and how much of it there is Why else would countless corporations register in the US state of Delaware using post office box addresses that guarantee their owners anonymity In fact Western democracies grant foreign wealth even more protection from scrutiny In a report aptly titled The UK s Kleptocracy Problem the London based think tank Chatham House revealed that the golden visas for sale to oligarchs from all over the world were granted after checks that were the sole responsibility of the law firms and wealth managers representing them In my country Greece following our state s effective bankruptcy in an oligarch could buy a no questions asked golden visa which also came with a Schengen visa and the opportunity to live and travel anywhere in the European Union for a measly Similar visas are sold by other fiscally stressed eurozone countries fueling a race to the bottom that the world s oligarchs greatly appreciate While there is good reason to focus on Russian money now that Russian bombs are destroying Ukrainian cities it is puzzling that only Russian billionaires are called oligarchs Why is oligarchy which means rule arche by the few oligoi considered an exclusively Russian phenomenon Are the Saudi or Emirati princes not oligarchic Do American billionaires like those now flocking to buy Chelsea FC smuggle less money out of their country than their Russian counterparts do or have less political clout Do they use such power better than the Russians Russia s wealthiest the top of the top have taken about half their wealth around billion out of Russia and stashed it in the UK and other havens At the same time America s wealthiest have taken around trillion out of the United States principally to avoid paying taxes So in terms of magnitude American plutocrats match every dollar that Russian plutocrats stash abroad to escape scrutiny with of their own As for the relative political clout of Russian and American billionaires it is not at all clear who has more While there is no doubt that a number of Russian oligarchs have President Vladimir Putin s ear he has more control over them than the American government has over its billionaires Since the US Supreme Court s decision affording corporations the right to donate to politicians as if they were persons America s richest accounted for of all campaign contributions It has proved to be an excellent investment in wealth preservation Is it by chance that in the years since the deregulation of campaign financing American billionaires have obtained the lowest tax rate in over a generation and the lowest among all wealthy countries Is it an accident that the US Internal Revenue Service is starved of resources According to an authoritative empirical study of the US legislative record none of this is an accident the correlation between what Congress enacts and what most Americans prefer is not significantly greater than zero So if non Russian billionaires are also oligarchs does the exclusive emphasis in the West on Russians mean that our oligarchs and those nurtured by our allies are in some sense better Here we are treading on treacherous ethical ground To argue that the Saudi billionaires behind the decade long devastation of Yemen are better than Abramovich is to invite mockery Putin would feel vindicated if we dared claim that the American oilmen who reaped a windfall from the illegal US UK invasion of Iraq were morally superior to the owners of Rosneft and Gazprom To be sure Putin s oligarchs turn a blind eye whenever a brave journalist is snuffed out in Russia But meanwhile WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange withers in a high security UK prison under conditions bordering on torture for having exposed Western countries war crimes following their illegal invasion of Iraq And how did Western oligarchs and governments respond when their Saudi business partners dismembered the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi Following Putin s invasion of Ukraine the UK government declared its determination to rip away the veil of secrecy and deception shrouding the money parked in Britain to escape the scrutiny of law enforcement and tax authorities Whether the reality matches the rhetoric remains to be seen Already there are signs of tension between the ambition to seize oligarchs money and the imperative of keeping Britain open for business Perhaps the only silver lining in the Ukrainian tragedy is that it has created an opportunity to scrutinize oligarchs not only with Russian passports but also their American Saudi Chinese Indian Nigerian and yes Greek counterparts An excellent place to start would be with the London mansions that Transparency International tells us sit empty How about turning them over to refugees from Ukraine and Yemen And while we re at it why not turn over Chelsea FC to its fans,Since the US Supreme Court s decision affording corporations the right to donate to politicians as if they were persons America s richest accounted for of all campaign contributions,1

I believe the economy is being manipulated to be artificially inflated so that when new federal minimum wage laws are voted in the stock market won t tank based on expected year over year earnings The status quo doesn t change poor people will still be more poor but they ll feel better because they re making more per hour And it s not a Democrat or Republican issue This is a bipartisan conspiracy to raise the minimum wage and maintain the US as a global economic powerhouse and the US dollar as the global currency,Inflation is deliberate so the stock market doesn t crash when new federal minimum wage laws are voted in,1

The way people are to be governed is defined by three measures from now on regulating the deadliness of a release virus normalizing rules to follow such as lockdowns limiting group events etc institutionalizing mandatory vaccines and boosters This is the vehicle to manage population numbers in the future They can t just release a deadly super contagious virus without a test run first They needed to know how good people would be at staying indoors disinfecting and cleaning surfaces wearing masks properly obeying widely accepted precautionary protocols If you observed as I have people are absolutely terrible at following rules Masks worn under the nose Touch stuff in public then use the same hand to scratch your eye or nose or even bring food into your mouth I can t tell you how many times I ve seen people put the mask down on a public dirty surface like a bench or bus subway seat or stuff it into a purse and then touch stuff and put it right back on their face to breathe in whatever microbes were just picked up We needed a mild virus as a test control a way to measure how many people they d really be wiping out The next wave in a few short years will be deadlier but we d have a protocol in place for people to follow and see as normal operating pandemic procedure Those who took every precaution to stay safe and still follow proper safety measures will be better prepared and survive In parallel to the virus the vaccines and rules are needed to roll out concurrently so the next wave of mandatory measures would be more widely accepted change my mind,COVID was a training exercise for what s to come,1
Say anything you can think of abt Biden Call him deranged or a pederast or corrupt or whatever you want they might all be true I cant argue w that But at the same time I m also positive that he has at one point in his life done at least one thing for someone other than himself Im positive that he has had the best of intentions has tried to benefit something other than his own ego or bank account on at least one occasion Has given a buck to a homeless guy played with a dog read a bed time story to a grandkid The same cannot be said for tr mp I just dont see it ever happening Is this a sad and pathetic state for our country to be in Of course it is Esp since we re at the point where TRMP SUPPORTERS are the ones calling themselves free thinkers and patriots The same m fers who also support BANNING BOOKS are the ones whining abt censorship Who invoke the holocaust while supporting openly anti semitic politicians Whose proudest day was one that included a cop getting beaten w an American flag theyre the ones w a monopoly on the word patriot Mind boggling PS for like generations it was the Left that had a lock on hating corpotations and promulgating ideas abt the goverment controlling the weather with its nefarious space jews or whatever else y all are into on tik tok nowadays,Another way to think abt the Left Right divide in America,1

gonna catch some heat for this but ya gt If Voting Made a Difference They Wouldn t Let Us Do It Many here seem to subscribe to this idea Yet no one seems to extrapolate this towards Trump If corruption is even as systemic as we suspect it to be why would Trump s election be real I think Trump was installed just like every other president for the last years because he was compliant with the powerful financial interests that control everything those which administrate transnational thinktanks like the Bilderberg Group World Economic Forum Skull amp Bones etc The group dulling out ESG scores to every multinational corporation on Earth Central bankers like Jerome Powell rich bloodlines like the Rothschilds investment kingpins like Larry Fink or otherwise It just baffles me that ardent Trump supporters on websites like patriots wn will crusade about the systemic corruption remark how was orchestrated then still proceed to believe that someone as ostensibly anti establishment as Trump would just nestle himself inside the white house with no political experience Plus consider how Trump had dealings with Epstein We know Epstein had deep connections to the ruling class Which is why he and his associate were assassinated in max security prisons We know that Trump has a long long history of meeting w the U S ruling class Countless photographs of him with the Clinton family I always empathized with Trump because I play devil s advocate because of my past So I saw the horrible slander of Trump as unjustified I kept a close eye on him and even supported his supporters despite not being sympathetic politically because they were under the gun Around I noticed a profound difference in Trump s behavior which I found perplexing He stopped being as outspoken started bowing refused to endeavor to fix the problems he described with the swamp which we are all familiar with He ran a populist platform yet often refused to meet directly with his supporters You would often see him waving at his supporters from a distance but rarely greeting them up close amp personal Towards the end of his term his candor became very cold I actually saw many former supporters of Trump get alienated I want to remark that I find it very strange that despite Trump being the object of such intense affection from the press he rarely seemed irked by it Almost like it was meaningless Fast forward towards the election protests in D C We know that there was a false flag operation being staged here There was an fierce intelligence presence all around the events of that day Trump was still incumbent he was not aware of these Afterwards he practically went dark for an entire year Literally nothing aside from the occasional press release His beliefs seemed to fade into the background The capital protestors which stormed the capital were seemingly abandoned by him I think it s worth emphasizing just how strange this period of time was between and where he basically fell off the map entirely That is very unusual for an outspoken entertainer like Trump Basically it just doesn t add up to me on any level I really sincerely do not believe Trump is who he says he is I don t think he would have been installed in the White House if he was An alternative way to view his election is whatever derelict enclave of American resistance were gaining momentum and needed an outlet Trump was their designated shepherd and led them astray Trump s time in office was probably the most transformative term in American history Not being of anything he did but the machine operating behind him seemingly with his indifference,Trump is another NWO pawn controversial opinion,1

gonna catch some heat for this but ya gt If Voting Made a Difference They Wouldn t Let Us Do It Many here seem to subscribe to this idea Yet no one seems to extrapolate this towards Trump If corruption is even as systemic as we suspect it to be why would Trump s election be real I think Trump was installed just like every other president for the last years because he was compliant with the powerful financial interests that control everything those which administrate transnational thinktanks like the Bilderberg Group World Economic Forum Skull amp Bones etc The group dulling out ESG scores to every multinational corporation on Earth Central bankers like Jerome Powell rich bloodlines like the Rothschilds investment kingpins like Larry Fink or otherwise It just baffles me that ardent Trump supporters on websites like patriots win will crusade about the systemic corruption remark how was orchestrated then still proceed to believe that someone as ostensibly anti establishment as Trump would just nestle himself inside the white house with no political experience Plus consider how Trump had dealings with Epstein We know Epstein had deep connections to the ruling class Which is why he and his associate were assassinated in max security prisons We know that Trump has a long long history of meeting w the U S ruling class Countless photographs of him with the Clinton family I always empathized with Trump because I play devil s advocate because of my past So I saw the horrible slander of Trump as unjustified I kept a close eye on him and even supported his supporters despite not being sympathetic politically because they were under the gun Around I noticed a profound difference in Trump s behavior which I found perplexing He stopped being as outspoken started bowing refused to endeavor to fix the problems he described with the swamp which we are all familiar with He ran a populist platform yet often refused to meet directly with his supporters You would often see him waving at his supporters from a distance but rarely greeting them up close amp personal Towards the end of his term his candor became very cold I actually saw many former supporters of Trump get alienated I want to remark that I find it very strange that despite Trump being the object of such intense affection from the press he rarely seemed irked by it Almost like it was meaningless Fast forward towards the election protests in D C We know that there was a false flag operation being staged here There was an fierce intelligence presence all around the events of that day Trump was still incumbent he was not aware of these Afterwards he practically went dark for an entire year Literally nothing aside from the occasional press release His beliefs seemed to fade into the background The capital protestors which stormed the capital were seemingly abandoned by him I think it s worth emphasizing just how strange this period of time was between and where he basically fell off the map entirely That is very unusual for an outspoken entertainer like Trump Basically it just doesn t add up to me on any level I really sincerely do not believe Trump is who he says he is I don t think he would have been installed in the White House if he was,Controversial Opinion Donald Trump is another NWO pawn,1

With so much contradicting information and values being available to everyone it has made it rather hard for people to tell who is being honest and who isn t anymore So the massess can be manipulated by the ruling groups and the media into doing the things they want through pop culture The people and groups who fight for decent authorities are persecuted instead If we are to rebuild society then children should be taught to value truth the importance of history and philosophy Since the ruling groups have such a good mastery of it It s not an issue for them to take over ignorant groups and nations It has to be countered by an economically and ethically strong population,The ethical confusion everyone is in should teach people the value of philosophy What should be the ideal education for children,1
And they were all chosen by Republicans Yet notice how when it s a Democrat choice there is zero controversy Even when they pick a candidate based ONLY on the fact that she is a Black Woman And not her qualifications Hardly a peep unless you watch Fox or any right wing media outlet Legacy Media is controlled by the Democrats New Media is controlled by the Democrats Yet they still resort to the same old tactics of accusing Republican candidates of Rape Justice Kavanaugh and Justice Thomas The black guy Joe Biden had a major role to play in accusing a black man like Thomas of Rape So someone explain to me the logic of denying a Black Man the chance to on the Supreme Court yet it s okay for him after accusing a Black Man of Rape to choose a Black Woman These petty racial politics is what s destroying the nation These fake sex crime accusations are serious yet Democrats have done it twice Democrats love to bring up But Merrick Garland was denied by Republicans Ya he was denied by Republicans His life and name wasn t destroyed by fake rape accusations like they tried to do Kavanaugh and Thomas And now he gets a great gig of being the Attorney General Seems like a win to me Democrats choose a Black Woman because they fear that Republicans will try to do the same thing that Democrats have a known History of doing to Republican candidates for the Supreme Court They think by choosing a Black Woman it isolates any controversy of there Sex Life Which Democrats have no problem going after Democrats have destroyed the confirmation process They have politicized every single branch of government Hell the even Weaponized a persons private medical choices like getting a Vaccine or you no longer have a job And of course all of the Democrat Justices voted for that illegal mandate while the Republicans voted against it,Democrats have accused multiple sitting Supreme Court Justices of RAPE,1

amp xB Why isn t every time we reach the imagination of reality that we want to create When does the law of attraction work Why everyone dream is not full filled Law of attraction as mentioned in the world famous book the secret says All your thoughts are creating reality half truth WRONG it s because of imagination of your reality frequency of your body and thoughts all combined actually are creating your reality Human body is a storage of frequency Based on what you think or what you eat its frequency is changing Imagination is the reality that already exists in quantum science and every imagination consists of a certain frequency and your body can receive thought for imagination based on frequency you are in Tv broadcast of different channels are done by frequency Similarly your imagination of the law of attraction is also at different frequencies and to communicate with that reality you have to learn to make your body at that frequency to receive thought to make you reach to the dream reality in less time Time is just the road to the memories How fast or slow is based on which frequency your body is in I will give examples of different scenarios individually then we will combine them to make it easier to understand better First you have to understand there s no time only memories or Imagination of different frequency how to observe that What you did last week or what you did in the past month or past year or whole life when you will think of answering me this question then you will see you will have memories which are imagination that will come to your mind you will say you did this and that Like going on a trip did this work etc etc but you won t feel time when recollecting it you will have references of when it occurred like a sequence but it won t occur in a time base you will remember the last few days very clearly if you can select time based because it has recently occurred but things which occurred more than a week ago you will see your memories have not stored time for it it s all memories where you cannot feel time Now in the future the same way there s imagination or memories exists but not time Now to observe imagination by frequency i will give you certain examples that you have experience in day to day life High frequency body in the morning or had eaten light food due to meditation or empty stomach or excercise remembering songs that you like or that makes you feel good meditation makes you recieve good thoughts or makes you feel high frequency or in peace high intuition for people who does able to get work done because imagination of work done is a high frequency memory all the good trip memories all the happy memories Low frequency body due to doing drugs eating heavy food watching too much tv blocked chakra negative thoughts channel getting more negative thoughts from past if one thing went wrong the reason people are never able to successfully quit smoking is because smoking is low frequency memory and whenever you are in low frequency you will see you need to smoke again complaining attracts more complaint not able to get work done after eating heavy food body frequency changes and you are attracting different channel So fasting works or meditation works to attract desired reality because we all want to be in higher frequency imagination but we should change our body channel to that frequency to receive faster download to reach the reality Thought don t create reality thought are coming from a reality for example let s say you have to go to office and you are repeating i don t want to be late now i will show that this thought is coming from different frequency imagination Then this thought can be coming from both imagination you are late low frequency memory and if you in low frequency you will receive thought which will make you reach late you are not late high frequency memory and if you are in high frequency then you will receive thought that will make you reach on time So to Correct way should be imagine i am never late high frequency memory now if your body in high frequency then you will receive thought to reach that reality Second if your body is not in high frequency then you can t hold the imagination that you are not late because your body will attract the imagination of you being late or running late which means you have to work on staying in high frequency The world has given us things to be in lower frequency and as a result we are never creating reality Oily foods addiction drugs addiction technology technology that requires our imagination etc etc Join this channel for more info to learn Manifestation by removing half false from reality,Manifestation of reality Part law of attraction imagination or memories frequency your body in,1

Instead we are indoctrinated from a very young age to be solely reliant on a fragile system that is clearly and intentionally in my opinion exploiting us and keeping most of us in a constant scarcity based fear flowing state of anxiety and others in a mass media and entertainment brainwashed state of blissful ignorance The very fabric of this existence is about making us powerless ignorant and selfish when we are naturally inclined to be individually empowered yet selfless and communal If you have young children please seek a way to teach them the essential living skills I outlined in the title Even if you don t know these skills find ways to engage both yourself and your children in these skills so that you are less reliant on a system that treats you as nothing more than an exploitable digit in a vast ocean of digits on a screen,Isn t it funny how self reliance is not taught in schools No classes about tending to a garden planting regional vegetables and trees working with soil building a greenhouse fishing hunting keeping chickens etc,1

By Cassandra Fairbanks Published March at am amp xB The Ukrainian government has repeatedly condemned Russia for its bombardment of residential areas that the besieged country claims have no strategic military equipment amp xB Today following a Russian missile strike on the Retroville shopping center in Kyiv the government has inadvertently backtracked on this position amp xB Earlier today the Security Service of Ukraine SBU announced that they had arrested a TikTokker who had filmed himself identifying the location of Ukrainian artillery near the Retroville mall in Kyiv Russian intelligence agents were assumed to have noticed the video and a missile strike was conducted on the area as a result amp xB The video shows a TikTokker who recently posted materials about the location of the Ukrainian military on the Internet the SBU stated Subsequently the shopping center near which our defenders were was subjected to a powerful missile strike by the Russian occupiers amp xB The Kremlin issued a statement confirming that the bombardment struck the intended target which the Russians claimed was housing rockets used by Ukrainians in nearby multi launch systems amp xB But Ukraine initially chose to dispute these assertions The office of the Prosecutor General condemned the strike as premeditated murder that violated the laws and customs of war implicitly arguing that the target was illegitimate and solely used by civilians A pre trial investigation is underway but the claims made by the Prosecutor General don t hold up to scrutiny amp xB With the arrest of the TikTokker who filmed the site before the strike occurred the SBU has confirmed that there were indeed legitimate military targets in and around the shopping center The Times also reported that Ukrainians claimed to have witnessed mobile missile launchers in the area amp xB And unfortunately for both the TikTokker and the SBU the assumption that Russia identified the location from posts on social media is contradicted by the release of aerial surveillance footage by the Kremlin In the video a UAV tails a number of Ukrainian military vehicles en route to the mall indicating that this strike wasn t the product of a loose lipped Ukrainian seeking internet fame amp xB Russian officials have long claimed that Ukraine s military is using the citizens as meat shields to either inhibit Russia s ability to attack or paint Russia as genocidal to the international community Media organizations throughout the world have largely scoffed at this claim but revelations uncovered by the strike at Retroville may indicate that there is some truth there after all,Ukraine Admits To Placing Artillery In Residential Areas Following Russian Missile Strike,1

No one really ask these questions all I see on reddit is russia weak russia only have nukes kind of posts and comments First of all it seems too simple to get that conclusion russia may be not as advanced as NATO on millitary tech but they are using very very old equipments and using unexperienced soldiers also with old tech is too suspicious Also russia has money to buy advanced weapons from china if it is really weak as everyone say The second question everyone has been asking on millitary themed sub reddits was why russia send its ground forces without air superiorty russia does not send any jets at all and there is no certain answer we were watching war footages on warleaks on YouTube and it is really impossible to send tanks to die without air assist like that if it is not intentional I could not find any discussion about these questions so I wanted to create one and have a discussion,Is russia really weak like it seems or do they use old guns old vehicles unexperienced soldiers intentionally,1
Its super complex stuff Dont get me wrong I m not saying a massive portion of this stuff isnt true But I am wondering who the fuck is pulling the strings Who is the one who came up with the grand plan and details of what needed to be done to execute it so successfully Is it one person Is it a group of people Where do they meet to discuss and plan this Is there a secret lair they all meet in like some big board room Or is one person controlling the whole thing like a hidden supreme human who no one but the world leaders knows but they all follow without question or hesitation Is it even a person Is it human Think about how many things all have to fit into place like a game of chess to make so much of this happen Now consider how many moves ahead they are planned I just dont think its possible for any human to have the power to call it on coordinate it and see it through let alone the mindblowing tactical forethought in planning to see the big picture so far in advance Thoughts,So lets suppose a lot of what we talk about here is right that these epic conspiracy theories are in fact truth There is an epic amount of strategic forethought and planning in so much of this So much in fact I have my doubts that any human could possibly be capable of planing managing it,1
in football soccer players get a yellow card when they take their shirt off when celebrating a goal this is a directive from sponsors because the cameras focus on the goalscorer when they are celebrating and if they don t have their shirt on the sponsors logos aren t able to be seen by viewers They want that image of the celebrating player on the TV on the news reports printed in the paper so that the sponsors on the shirt get seen by everyone So the sponsors issue a directive that they want the players to be made to keep their shirt on resulting in a booking,Yellow cards in football,1
Big data is a term used to describe a programming systems specialty It involves rapidly processing large amounts of information This was very important about fifteen years ago because of Google s revolutionary business model It involves a Free To Play system Everyone can use it then you tag and track your users Sell the data to other companies Sometimes you can even sell that data in real time It was The new marketplace The elites wanted everyone to get an RFID chip Get a chip implanted in your hand they said The general public thought that this was a ploy to get everyone chipped so that they could be tracked by The government or The illuminati or Some one And then maybe they could be controlled too They were half right The idea is a lot less ego centric than that They want to track you not so they can harass you individually They simply want to track you so they can bundle all that information together and sell it to others who may suddenly decide they wish to harass you It s all about business and profits No one liked the RFID chip idea Pretty much no one Some groups continued pushing it some even offer it to this day but it is mostly dead in the water But then G came along G allows cell phone systems to do so much more than G can A customer won t understand it They ask Is it faster Is it more reliable Is it cheaper The answer was typically No but you HAVE TO GET IT NOW And here is the reason Visa Mastercard started putting chips in their credit cards for Europe It was tedious and expensive A security feature that really didn t do a good job of stopping credit card theft Everyone asked whether or not Visa Mastercard would expand the whole Chip and Pin program and they stalled Said I don t know maybe maybe eventually But then G appeared on the horizon With a G cellphone tower they could ping the RFID chip on a credit card and get a unique signal back Suddenly it all came together They could track every single customer who held a credit card at least in real time wherever they want They could then bundle and sell all of that information Not only could they tell people what you bought and where you bought it But they could then track you wherever you went indefinitely You may have wondered why your cell phone company immediate demanded you get a G capable phone the minute they came on the market Well that is because they had decided to transition absolutely all cell phone towers to G Everyone had to be on G in order to remain a customer and there was no more room for G or G Visa Master card were now in bed with the telecom companies and if you have a credit card with that chip on it then your name and habits have been sold to vendors dozens of times by the time you got done reading this post You ve already been chipped my friend They just didn t bother to tell you,Big Data Big Data Big Data,1

So an easy way to explain gang stalking is that gangstalkers are crisis actors who create false flags and people s lives then they act out the false flags trying to bring life to their lies I have noticed that the gang stalker crisis actors will bring around certain props that I know have something to do with the false flags that they created One of the props that they bring around me a lot are bags and they have negatively conditioned me with this based off of terror tactics that they re using against the people that they target and I knew there s something behind these bags that they are bringing into my life I m wondering if other other people who are being targeted are seeing the same props being brought into their life because what I ve noticed is that these criminals who Target people use copy and paste tactics on the people they target to make them look like the people who they really are Here s a video showing the crisis actors using bags and these bags are being brought into my life because they re projecting who they really are they are the ones who put people into bags just like the government Mafia puts people into body bags when they send them off to war these people are no different false flags are created to create wars on the grand scale and on in people s personal lives A video of crisis actors putting people in body bags Rawd b crisactgermantv,Gangstalkers are crisis actors,1
I am tired of the truths that I have known or the patterns that I see being labeled as conspiracy theories Especially the latter half where one sees patterns and comes up with a theory as to how it will play out Isn t this how basic science works This Ukraine thing I am taking very personally The hatred that the global masses have to the Russians is upsetting This takes me back to being in school where all it took was kid to instigate and the next thing you know your getting picked on by half the class I never thought in my lifetime I would see hatred to races or religions I thought it was something that would be part of our history But now I see it never goes away it just changes targets Except this is the first time in my life span where I have witnessed hatred to an individual just because of where they are born or live Getting back to the headline Are we fucked Do we have any hope in changing the direction of society I need to set new expectations for my life and the world around me Now that the people who have kept their heads in the sand and stayed ignorant to what govt is truly up to are now glued and fueled by govt every word I am ready to be the ignorant one,Even if MSM was taken over and unfiltered truth was released on the airwaves I don t think most of society would believe it,1
Gangstalkers Crisis actors are the ones who created false flags on a micro level in people s personal life And on a macro level on the world stage It s a shame that people get payed to act out lies to make them believable This is done to get real people emotionally involved by hoes that we will accept their lies ad truth I feel like a lot of times false flags are acted out to where no one actually gets hurt or passes away however I have noticed that these people who participate in gang stalking or crisis acting put themselves in danger because if their superiors call for a realistic false flag where people die they will be the ones who will be sacrificed by their own to make a lie look believable For the most part crisis actors and gang stalkers get paid to lie to us Rawd b crisiactcontract,Crisis actors are the ones who created False Flags,1

I got into a debate with an all or nothing christian and fear i wrote a lot to be disregarded so maybe others will enjoy it here The rule set of its current state makes for a very productive gathering All you have to do is join the club and you ll be eternally blissful Only sin that will not be forgiven is to doubt this group You can commit any misdeeds and will be forgiven This adds up to satanism because you don t have to face your victims You just conjure up an entity who will forgive you so you can ignore your actions consequences and dismisses virtue as a futile endeavor when salvation is dirt cheap for every sinner equally Lets look at actual reality Jesus was a man named Esa Cleopatra gave birth to twins and then gave birth to Esa The female of those two twins was Selena Esa might be a fine manly name in Egypt but in the Roman world nouns ending with a are feminine There also were not J s back then Yoolius kaysar is julius caesars phonetic name A ianitor was a door guard Iacio iacere ejectus Yakio yakere eeyectus To throw So esa would be esus But esus is to eat Proper nouns had a y noise in front of them while verbs and adjectives had bare vowels So esus would be iesus like julius used to be iulius Cleopatra and julius had a child that was pursued after julius was killed by rich folk Julius was a people friendly guy and crossed the rubicon to change things Marc antony was part of juilius political movement and dies with cleopatra fighting the money So this makes iesus the son of an emperor The son of god And he is sent away to the east in his teenage years with a virgin handmaid to flee octavians pursuit The money doesnt want an heir to julius upstart people centered government Thats why they crucify him And made the martyr that changed the world Now back to selena When a lady became a royal roman her name is given magda In the dead sea scrolls jesus says to his wife Is an excerpt Also it is known jesus turns water to wine at the wedding of a twin And on top of that selena would be called magdalena by romans considering her royalty All of the parts of the Bible that speak of one true way and superstitious nonsense surrounding his death and resurrection are added in by idiots wanting to push agendas like King James All the parts that say just join the club and you get eternal salvation That jesus was given by god to wash your sina clean All the pope edicts where they say murder everyone on a crusade and you will get into heaven no matter what Any way that they were able to sell these f crusades All of it is Satan corrupting the word of Jesus All institutions corrupt over time because only those who seek power hardest get to take the power in the institution It s not all simple as a get out of hell free card Every church gives the wrong answer to whether goodness is good without Christ involved They make sayings like goodness is a zero and Christ is one Goodness means nothing unless Christ comes first I was asked how can the answer be found in drugs instead of a church I explained the same way people go through near death experiences and find AN answer Theres not one answer like all of creation is a test problem There are many answers to life s questions If you looked upon God how much of his majesty could you comprehend A biologist sees the balance of nature and his genetic codes magnificence A physicist sees the laws and substance of creation A computer coder may marvel upon the NC complete coding of pi and quantum coupling heuristics A believer just sees what he hopes to see a god that excuses him from not using reason the false god made by king james that burns you in hell for eternity if you don t follow the order The corrupted word that sent crusades against humanity s diversity murdering millions in genocides all in the name of a pacifist I really hope for your sake God s not that complicated and he s just looking out for a string of monkeys on a single rock orbiting a small yellow dwarf star just to give out gold stars for his VIP lounge where you watch most people you know burn in hell There is a strong tendency within the human mind to obey the powers that be It s a smart strategy seeing as how my kind used to be burned on the stake Back in the day of witch burning you d be a trooper This day and age it s kind of like you re lazy and hiding from goodness in your little chapel of madness since you cant accept faith as a good thing no matter the belief I could never be at peace in heaven if billions burned because they had loving families of a different faiths Would you Id go to hell and save them or keep them company Theres muslims that think youll burn for hearing of muhammad and not accepting him same as you are thinking those people burn because they heard of jesus and didnt accept him God doesnt play favorites and you hoping to be special is going to disappoint you in the end Especially if you never cared about other people and how doing good matters If there is a selfish entity that picks a few billion out of the billion that have came and went from particular circumstance that entity is not the alpha and omega The three letter word for everything Because we are part of everything We are part of god You want god to cut off his nose to spite his face D a r e and churches do the opposite of teach you reason If you believe genesis you know that gods greatest gift is free will and reason He couldnt have been truly angry when the apple got eaten he put it in reach and forbade it to test us for free will If hes all knowing he knew the moment would come How is he angry Emotions are the result of ignorance and surprise Someone added that part to make us fear disobeying dogma People began teaching that story in a different way to inspire subjugation and now it focuses on the paradise lost instead of the reason gained The dead sea scrolls have the unadulterated story focusing on reason and free will what the angel Lucifer was jealous of It s sad that everyone now thinks of the story in the same light as Lucifer spiteful of reason The original writer of genesis was a member of egyptian pharoahcy hence us saying the Egyptian sun god amen at the end of every prayer Does that mean he s burning right now Ironic The writers of the bible had beautiful morals and wisdom to make their words prosper and repeat but not every set of ears and lips shared that wisdom Translations get lost Good words get burned for not being part of the agenda And people lose touch with goodness as they tow the line and repeat words like parrots instead of finding their meaning and spreading their wisdom That is why jesus said do not repeat yourself like the heathens do with ceremony Steal yourself to a closet and worship there This is also why when jesus was asked about sinai and zion Which is the true church He responds the only true temple is through me He also says we re all the children of god same as him His message has been lost in the bureaucracy and hypocrisy of repeating about the one true way So now youll pigeon hole and say only through jesus See No Use reason What happens to all the souls before jesus What happens to buddhists You know jesus went to nepal when fleeing octavian Two men in and claimed they translated buddhist historical articles and found mention of a gifted prince that came from africa and grew up learning and teaching upon the virtues of monks He then went back to the east and spread the values of buddhism to the romans Of course those articles disappeared when the Catholic Church came to investigate Same as how the dead sea scrolls that said jesus was married disappeared over the ages You know selena or magdalena She was on an egyptian coin and shes the woman in the statue of liberty made by the NWO The skull and bones bastards who spit on the bible Those fuckers are laughing in our faces about how they corrupted true history Jesus being an earthly man who sacrificed himself for his ideals is just as beautiful if not a more inspiring story That we are all capable of divinity We are all children of god who must do good just because it is good to do Jesus didn t have a church seminary and d a r e rubric to follow when he attacked the jewish temple He sacrificed himself to change the world and make us look at our sins He didnt fuckin make a god bomb explosion that washes us clean of our sins like a lamb being sacrificed in a satanic spell to excuse ourselves for committing horrors against each other Some bearded entity is not going to forgive you for the sins you ve committed against others the people you have wronged must forgive you because they are the part of god that was wronged Having a superstitious scapegoat to not face your victims sounds like something a murderous dictator would imagine to escape from judgement By saying sorry to a faceless entity we imagined up we don t face our problems or grow virtue We can just chalk it up that god will save us and forgive us as long as we really want eternal happiness and ask nicely in the way our church told us What bullocks Use your reason,Christianity was corrupted over time by those that sought power in its institutions,1

The specter of communism did not disappear with the disintegration of the Communist Party in Eastern Europe The collapse of the communist regimes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe marked the end of a half century long Cold War between the capitalist and communist camps in the East and West Many were thus optimistic holding the belief that communism had become a relic of the past The sad truth however is that a stealthily transformed communist ideology has instead taken hold and entrenched itself around the world There are the outright communist regimes like China North Korea Cuba and Vietnam there are the former Soviet Union and Eastern European countries where communist ideology and customs still exert a significant influence there are the African and South American countries which attempt socialism under the banner of democracy and republicanism and then there are the nations of Europe and North America whose body politics have become host to communist influences without people even realizing it amp xB A must watch if you want to understand why the world is the way it is right now ab channel NTD ab channel NTD,How the Specter of Communism Is Ruling Our World,1

So I m managing a group of gamers Everyone is an adult in this group Members First of all to manage it successfully there had to be rules implemented Rules that must everyone obey so the place can be peaceful at all time Every now and then someone breaks the rules and starts some kind of drama Notice those are adults Some start to fight over really unnessescary stuff Spread negativity and annoy other people with it I gotta monitor that at all times I have to balance it Because I cannot just remove people because they are having friends aswell who will shit on me aswell if I remove someone of them But most of the time I think I do well I have to be a strict leader who is balancing it all out I tend to remove people who are absolutely not reasonable And take it as a tradeoff for the better good Humans are disgusting dumb and unorganized Chaotic None of them ever think steps ahead and worry about what would their actions mean to the community Then Im thinking MAN if this is just a community of members How the fuck does the government rule over millions of them Millions of retards to manage Who are unreasonable You got the police who tries to bring order but often they fail because it is just difficult So I thought of Fear Fear is the only way you can actually control the people If you threaten to remove certain things if you threaten to radically impose changes You can have possible control over people If you successfully manage to keep the majority in that fearstate and obedience you can rule peacefully over your country and manage things Impose changes or maintain the society as it is Speaking from a leader perspective here Of course there are dumb absolutists who only care to lead only for the sake of their own ego I try to care about people but its so damn difficult to balance it all out And you can do it only over fear and rules and respect Im thinking about this covid thing There is a gigantic plan behind all of this A radical change in technology the way we will live perhaps for the better and its only the way through the things they do Yes for us its stupid to take vax to wear masks all the time to show ur passports and stuff But this shit is probably meant for all the cunts that need to be controled so there wont be chaos while imposing change and maintaining some kind of order What do you think For me I m really disappointed in humanity A lot o people are really really dumb Rivalry Selfishness and not looking after one another Absolute cancer,Ever lead a large group of people And what a chaos it is,1

Hey guys I m y o I m going to go on a bit of a tangent before I get to the point here lol since I was a child I ve been fascinated by the mystical and spectacular sides to life I watched ancient aliens when I was y o for the first time and from there and onward became obsessed with the alien phenomena and all other paranormal and esoteric things When I was I went down the agenda rabbit hole and intuitively knew there would be a catastrophe in to charge the world ahead into a new age I thought it would be an economic collapse but it seems the pandemic was a lubricant Anyways in todays world I feel if I was to be checked in with a therapist I would be medically diagnosed as a schizo because I don t fit into society and it s norms and I see the world from a more shamanic perspective This has been bothering me a lot lately because I feel socially inept and lonely Uncertain of the future I can t seem to TRULY enjoy the company of my peers or young people in general I m a smart guy empathetic and deep I look after myself and my loved ones But I m starting to feel a disconnect to the mainstream public social cues and small talk without meaning to sound pretentious I feel I have a strong higher awareness and a need to eliminate excess karma Do you think a lot of diagnosed schizos or even bipolar people ADHD etc are just creative and abstract minded people I don t like the labels I m only using them as a reference for what I m trying to say here If you ve read this far thank you I would like to hear your thoughts,Possible Link between Schizophrenia and spirituality,1

From Kash Patel s Substack What is Devolution The concept of Devolution is fundamental and part of the government s top secret continuity of government plans I will cover the continuity of government plans in detail in a future post Check out this Newsweek article from While the report presents Devolution in the context of the pandemic it still provides enough detail to prove that Devolution exists and was a topic explored by Trump From the Newsweek Article The article was published March and claims Standby orders were issued more than three weeks ago to ready these plans That means in February of Trump had ordered the military to review and prepare the continuity of government plans I think the timeline of this is essential,Devolution Conspiracy theory or possibility,1

Tesla admitted before his death that he came from a time in the future when energy was free clean and abundant People lived in peace benefitted from a technological world where where technologies weren t in the possession of the few powerful to use as influence over the masses Tesla attempted to introduce those technologies while he was alive and guide humanity towards that future However the cabal prevented him and successfully sidelined him Hitler came from the same future A future where the cabal had lost all its power and could no longer control the would through scarcity debt and monopolization of capital The cabal sent Hitler back in time to create our current timeline by starting WW Tesla saw our current timeline with his alternate reality machine and went back in time himself to try to ensure the world was guided towards the good timeline Unfortunately Tesla failed in his quest He completely underestimated the strength of the cabal in the past and they successfully managed to keep him from having any meaningful influence Hitler succeeded in his quest And now that the good timeline has ceased to exist humanity is trapped under the cabal forever,Hitler and Tesla were both time traveling agents,1
If it is possible to do this before the facts on the laptop most likely bring down Biden and it only get worse from there Anyone any reasonable thinking person who used to think Trump was bad orange man must now agree that the years he was President were much better than the short time senile Joe has been in office e g no war low gas prices strong world leader etc etc The conspiracy is the election was rigged and our country in now in grave danger of big trouble for all Americans China laughed at Biden when he asked them for help with Russia the same way the Colombian drug suppliers laugh at politicians who claim we are stopping the flow of drugs from Colombia with all our payments to them to stop the flow of drugs when the truth is more cocaine is shipped to the USA today than ever before and the drug suppliers know it The same way China knows it was paid off with bribes and inside deals made paid by the Biden supporters family This laptop which we here at r conspiracy KNEW was real but we everyone was banned from talking about it or spreading the facts is most likely going to bring down Biden and things in this country are who knows how bad it could be esp if whathernameVP becomes POTUS She has already shown she is incapable of doing anything she has been in charge of yet ever in her entire history of schmoozing her way in to positions of power,Is it possible that we they someone in charge can say Ok we have finished the investigation and the facts prove that the election was actually rigged votes for Biden were double and triple counted and without that fraud President Trump won and will now be reinstated as POTUS,1

Ron Paul The Coming Financial Police State Who controls the food supply controls the people who controls the energy can control whole continents who controls money can control the world Henry Kissinger For years I ve been warning the Fed is dead serious about creating Central Bank Digital Currency In a Washington D C Swamp lobbying front called the Digital Dollar Project demanded and got hearings in both houses of Congress Joe Biden campaigned on supporting the Fed s previously announced shift toward a real time payment system And now that Biden is in the White House National Public Radio reported the U S is considering a radical rethinking of the dollar for today s digital world The mass media is being misleading of course It s not just being considered they re planning and preparing to end private financial transactions completely Using Threats to Grow Resilience In Every Industry Every Country Every Day One Global Network Thought Leadership Those words are from marketing of the global consulting firm that created the Digital Dollar Project And without your action today including your signed petition I m concerned this Orwellian tempest will prove far worse than anything we ve seen in our lifetimes We re talking about the end of private financial transactions altogether government goons knowing where every dollar you make and spend ends up even determining what you can and cannot spend them on You want to spend your money on a new shotgun for hunting I don t think so because the world would be a better place without guns You want to buy a Mustang to restore it No way because it s a gas guzzler that is bad for the environment The list goes on and on and on The truth is the statists have no intention of limiting this Orwellian technology to your finances So don t think this isn t the other side of the coin to Bill Gates and Dr Fauci s calls for Vaccine Passports The authoritarians and their elite pals want nothing less than a complete digital ledger of every citizen s entire life You don t have to connect many dots to see it Here s what I need you to do First sign your Directive to Congress Do Not Allow the Fed to Implement Digital Currency Then after you have please chip in with as generous a contribution as you can afford to help Campaign for Liberty recruit and mobilize more patriots to bring this power grab to a crashing halt There s no question the Biden administration is using global chaos to usher in an Orwellian surveillance state As Joe Biden himself told a class of graduating elites at Columbia University in From this pandemic you can remake the world as it should be To see Covid as the force majeure that compels us to rewrite the social contract And in their eyes as it should be means a world where your money your job and your speech are all under TOTAL government Central Bank control In other words a world where we all work for the state aka Communism Patriot ultimately all of this is headed to a world where you and I and everyone else are enslaved to a few powerful elites with the means to monitor what we do say think have or don t have in our bodies Tell Congress Right Now Protect What Is Left of the Integrity of the Dollar Do Not Allow the Fed to Implement Any Type of Digital Currency The Big Government statists in BOTH parties are fully on board with all of this Together with the so called experts they peddle familiar talking points including Preserving the Dollar s hegemony ENDLESS WARS Serving under banked minorities and people of color RACIST EQUITY SCHEMES Preventing the spread of Covid LOCKDOWNS and of course Protecting us from terrorists and criminals TRIED AND TRUE TRIPE In fact they all but declared you are a criminal if you want to do something radical like keep your financial life private They ll tell you it s no big deal unless you have something to hide That s no surprise The Big Government statists in Congress LOVE this scheme to expand their RAW POWER over your life and liberty For them it s not enough the Fed s print now ask questions later monetary policy helps them pretend they aren t destroying the purchasing power of your money They want the ability to spend and spend on every boondoggle and bailout put in front of them without the hindrance of the Fed actually having to print the paper dollars they create out of thin air So don t be fooled by their talking points they re nothing more than excuses to RAM through adoption of their Central Bank Digital Currency And don t trust for one second their assurances about data privacy safeguards there likely won t be a shred of privacy left if this scheme goes through Sadly I m worried without your action today there are a handful of elected officials in Congress who should know better who could go along with this scheme if you and I fail to sound the alarm So can I count on you to please sign our Directive to Congress to Oppose Any Digital Currency Scheme right away And then please agree to a generous contribution of or more I know that might be a lot to ask for But the looming battle to stop this scheme could prove one of the most important Campaign for Liberty has ever fought So won t you please join me in shouting DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER before it s too late before the idea of American liberty is nothing more than a distant memory Please sign your Directive to Congress to Oppose Any Digital Currency Scheme and pitch in with your most generous gift TODAY For liberty Dr Ron Paul Chairman P S It may be their most Orwellian scheme yet the global elites Big Government authoritarians and the banksters at the Federal Reserve are linking arms to impose Central Bank Digital Currency and force you and me onto a so called Digital Dollar We re talking about the end of private financial transactions altogether government goons knowing where every dollar you make and spend ends up even determining what you can and cannot spend them on php Ron Paul The Coming

The war that rages in Ukraine right now starts to affect our life greatly with disturbing news about the food crisis a drop in the usual income an increase in prices for many vital goods And not so long ago I delved into the information that appeared in our media about biological laboratories The number of these laboratories is amazing amp xB According to the statements of many officials Ukrainians were allowed to host about such laboratories that conducted various studies of especially dangerous diseases and methods of mass infection of large areas These research centers were not under the control of the Ministry of Health Protection of Ukraine This information bring a question why do so many laboratories at all and why doesn t the ministry monitor their activities According to media statements these biolabs operate under the control of America or rather the Pentagon which is the headquarters of the US Department of Defense On whom is America going to test this type of weapons of mass destruction amp xB I have found only one answer for myself so far each of these research centers is developing its own unique sort of biological weapons that pose a potential threat to the entire European continent The United States has placed dangerous laboratories far from its territory and this will help them to avoid the negative consequences of possible leaks of various strains of pathogenic viruses thereby jeopardizing not only Ukraine but also the whole of Europe,Biolabs in Ukraine,1

Was listening to NPR just now while doordashing in Chicago and the host is talking to a dem guest about the Biden supreme Court nominee The Host asks what the guest thinks about a certain statement made by a republican questioner during the hearing that went something like in everyone of your cases dealing with underage nude images of children you went less than the states maximum minimum or what was recommended by the state The host goes on to say that some fact checking website says this is not true because she went with what prosecutors recommended a number of times or something to that effect The guest goes on to say that he can t say what he thinks about those charges on a family friendly radio program but that this is a non issue and it should not be discussed any further I m not jumping on any conspiracy bandwagons for siding with any political party or even suggesting anything I just believe when talking about something as serious as that saying it s a non issue and it should not be discussed any further was one of the most wild things I ve ever heard in my life Specifically when talking about a supreme Court Justice nominees possible Ascension to the bench I think their background and how they ruled on cases should definitely be discussed,Republican brings up nominees history of going easy on CP defendants during questioning of biden s judicial nom,1

Spam emails always seem fishy Despite Google basically owning the internet spam seems to creep through into the inbox daily Without constant daily deletion these would fill up and clog the system pretty quickly used storage space wouldn t take too long in the grand scheme of things maybe a year So why doesn t google just eliminate them altogether based on machine learning algorithms Spam emails are on purpose The internet will presumably exit for a long time and at some point data will become more and more of a commodity If billions of defunct accounts continue on indefinitely there d be no way for Google to keep up years from now there has to be a system in place to clear out the old making way for the new That s where spam comes in Google basically allows unused emails to fill up with spam so that it can terminate them If an account isn t used for a year or or the spam will eventually act as an automatic storage cutoff switch indicating that the owner has died or at least stopped responding at which point the account can be archived and or deleted for good,Spam Emails Death Notice,1
This came to me while taking a friend to the city for a medical consultation There is a lot of waiting involved When your appointment is for am the doctor will finally see you at pm I think this is standard Dentist at pm Your procedure will commence at pm If you re flying please arrive at the airport two hours before your departure so that you can wait TPTB realized long ago that people have less time to cause trouble when they re being forced to wait Between waiting and working the average person has practically no time for shenanigans Even McDonalds is in on it We used to get fast food at the drive thru window but now we arrive at the window and we re directed to a temporary parking spot so that we can continue to wait for our food It s all waiting and it s all by design Control of the populace is achieved by forcing us into situations of boredom anxiety that we can t remove ourselves from without losing our spot in the queue and having to go back and start waiting all over again This is the Grand Scheme Of It I m very hungry I can t even leave to go grab a bite or else I ll have to wait for a new parking spot when I get back here Waiting to wait It s fucking insidious,I Have Concluded That The Grand Ultimate Conspiracy Is Waiting,1

This morning my buddy sent a couple links describing the collapse of the dollar by the nd tomorrow Now we know we have to take all of this with a grain of salt because the internet is chock full of disinformation to keep us all looking like kooks but CERN is scheduled to be fired up again tomorrow so I don t know how they connect but I don t know anything anymore Without being a fear mongering wacko it just seems like it could make sense to collapse the dollar on the same day you start smashing particles and trying to do weird shit Anyhow just wondering if anyone can share some facts concerning this,Does anyone have any real insight into this,1
The last week the service staff of airport in Pisa discovered a large shipment of weapons and special equipment which was disguised as humanitarian aid for Ukraine Probably the cargo would have been delivered to Poland and than transported to Ukraine After discovering the fact that Italian government has sent weapons the airport staff started on strike and refused to load planes with such humanitarian aid The main reason for that is that everybody is against this war and these workers try to keep Italy out of war Everyday hundreds of tons of humanitarian cargo travel from all over Europe to Ukraine Ukraine needs help from our countries But is it legal to send weapons under the guise of humanitarian aid As I have said hundreds of trucks cross the Ukrainian border everyday and every truck is a possible arms carrier If it is real and russians will find out this fact every this truck after crossing the border will become a potential aim for them Russians have showed their weapons their hypersonic missiles and their power Just imagine how they will destroy a convoy with humanitarian weapons with such missile there will be dozens of injured and dead including citizens of the EU I just want to ask you Is it legal to provide shipments of arms under the guise of humanitarian aid Does it violate any UN conventions Do You support such initiative P S Please leave Your comments below It is very interesting to hear Your position over the questions,Humanitarian weapons,1
We have been seeing a push to make anti big government pro constitution nationalist patriots look like domestic extremists over the years During Trump s term Russiagate was pushed hard And when Burisma became a focal point the DNC claimed Russia hacked Burisma Trump and his supporters were constantly labeled as nazis and white supremacists BLM and antifa were given passes but proud boys were labeled domestic extremists by msm and DC During Trump s presidency Trump played nice with Putin and I noticed that because of the russiagate and burisma nothing burgers that were being pushed Trump s supporters were warming up to Putin Sort of an enemy of my enemy type of thing And let s not forget about the Jan th insurrection Officers removing barricades and waving crowds in a refusal on Pelosi s part to allow the national guard to be there The people that were there whether they went into the capital or not were viewed as domestic extremists Even the woman who was beaten to death by a cop while unconscious And here we are Ukraine vs Russia Most leftists are pro Ukraine and any pro Russia people are more likely to be on the right Like many of you I noticed a lot of pro Putin dialogue happening Either on the internet or in person Typically the people siding with Russia are Trump supporters Although it s hard to distinguish reality vs fiction during these times of hyped up propaganda it seems the pro Russia people have been trained to assume everything is fake when they hear about Russia Right now you have folks like Tucker Carlson and Tulsi Gabbards indirectly encouraging people to question the msm narrative while you have Mitt Romney and others accusing the pro Russia people of committing treason Is this a part of the bigger plan to continue to turn Trump supporters conservatives constitutionalists nationalists patriots into domestic terrorists Will there come a time when speaking highly of Putin or even just questioning the official narrative will cause mass arrests Is this a possible trap I believe that Putin and Zelensky are both WEF puppets and we are being led to a one world totalitarian government with massive tracking social credit scores and transhumanism The Great Reset is real and everything that has happened since is leading us there I know some of you feel the same But I see some right wingers not all who view Putin as a hero who is standing up to the evil elites It s just like they did with Trump Putin vs establishment They ve been trained to believe this narrative,Russia Russia Russia,1
